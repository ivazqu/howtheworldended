Steamships changed navigation as ships were no longer bound to seasons and winds. Marcus Samuel can be credited for the invention of this (founder of Shell, Iraqi-Jew).

The British govt. had backed Samuel and the development of Murex (the first ship) as they felt they could gain an upper hand against the most dominant oil company then, Standard oil. They had feared that Standard would enter Asia (yr. 1898). Within a few years steamships became standard for the shipment of [[Oil]].
