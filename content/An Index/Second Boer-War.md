The Second Boer-War was a conflict between the British Empire and “Boer ethnic” Republics, which were the decedents of Dutch settlers dating back from the 17th century. 

The Anglo-Boer War (October 1899) was a building of more than a centuries worth of conflict, especially after the British occupation of the Cape from 1795 to 1803, and then from 1806 and onward. The occupation was an inheritance from the Dutch, Flemish, German, and French, which dates back to 1652 of April, when Jan Van Riebeeck arrived at Table Bay in the Cape so that he could establish a refreshment station for the Dutch East India Company. A few years later he would release some workers from the company and allow them to settle as farmers (in order to reduce cost/make the company more self-sufficient). This was a shift to an agrarian economy, which led to slavery and slaves being imported from Asia and other parts of Africa. The farmers that had settled did not have the capital / labour to cultivate crops for profit. This shifted much of their focus to livestock, which meant the necessity to expand beyond the Cape Peninsula. By the late 18th C., _trekboers_ (white livestock-herders) had advanced from the winter rainfall to the summer rainfall zone. Those in the summer rainfall zone had existed there since the first millennium AD. 

The British faced a diverse group of indigenous tribes which the Dutch had been facing for over a century. The Cape was primarily a naval base for the British into their Asian occupations, but due to ongoing hostilities within South Africa their naval base was threatened. Between the years 1807-1852, there were several internal conflicts; such as, native revolts, settler violence (leading to the establishment of the Republic of the Orange Free State, the ZAR ‘Zuid-Afrikaanische Republiek,’ and the Transvaal), farming, and labour. In the mid-19th century Britain would recognize the independence of the Boer communities, but would ultimately "re-nig" once they had heard of a discovery of diamonds and other rare minerals (thus mining industry is fueled and more Asian immigration). The ZAR would eventually be annexed into the British Cape Colony in 1881. This would result in nearly two decades of tit for tat conflict, and would inevitably lead to both the British and Boer communities, in 1897, to purchase fire arms from either the Germans or French. That same year the ZAR would pass the Aliens Expulsion Law, Immigration Law, and the Press Law to limit the influence of British. 

Over 100 years of settler colonial violence and settlements a midst of [[Monoculture Commodities]] laws and extractions, voting and land rights, as well as, parliamentary powers fueled and ignited the Boer-War. 

The Boer War commenced shortly after when Paul Kroger, after a conference in Bloemfontein (1899), rejected the demand to reduce residence requirement for voting rights (14 to 5 years). Alfred Milner would request 10000 British troops, and Kruger would implement a 48 hour ultimatum for the British troops to be removed from the border and for the reinforcements to be prevented from landing. Kruger would take a chance in the British not having enough reinforcements against the Boers. That same year the war would commence in three phases (which I won’t go into great detail except for the last phase in the middle of the war).

The British in the last phase of the war at the battle of Dalmanutha, which was the largest Battle and led to more guerrilla warfare, issued a warning that if more rail and telegraph connections were destroyed, all houses would be burnt down; leading to a “Scorched Earth Policy.” The war would ensure from 1899 to 1902.
