Neoliberalism is a theory of political economic practices that proposes that human well-being can best advanced by liberating individual entrepreneurial freedoms and skills within an institutional framework characterized by strong private property rights, free markets, and free trade. The state is to create and preserve institutional framework by abiding to these traits: It must guarantee the quality and integrity of money; by setting up [[Militarism|military]], defense, police, and legal structures (such as the IMF, World Bank, and U.S [[Banks|banking]] system) and functions required to secure private property rights and to guarantee, by force, the functioning of markets (if they donâ€™t exist, they must be created). The emphatic turn can be traced in the 70s (although its history stretches far back). Neoliberalism emphasizes the contractual relationships within the market place. Social good will be maximized by maximizing the reach and frequency of market transactions; all human action flows into the domain of the market; thus producing [[Telecommunications|technologies of information]] creation and capacities to accumulate, store, transfer, analyze, and use massive databases to guide decisions in the global marketplace. The greater the geographical range [[Globalization |globalization]] and the shorter the term of market contracts, the better.
