Walter Benjamin, in 1925, found cargo ports to be a sensory extravaganza. During a visit to Genoa on a freighter, he described the cacophony of unloading freighters as the "music of the world," reflecting the cosmopolitan nature of these bustling hubs.

That music is now dead. 

Ports are hubs for trade that live along shorelines. At one point they were formed due to natural occurrences within the landscape, deep water along the shores, how currents moved, peninsulas, and so forth. As empires grew and technological advancements improved, dredging (a way of clearing sand and deepening the water) became a technique in order to create ports; ports over time became more strategic.

Ports had existed in the Gulf, and throughout the "East," prior to the onset of colonial violence. Pearl trading was an integral part of the economy, history, and tradition in the Gulf prior to the 19th century, and with it a long strand of goods and a network across the Silk Road. Goods were traded between the Gulf and India before the Dutch and Portuguese had entered the scene. And before the introduction of the steamship, which would eventually be replaced by [[Tanker (Ships)|tankers]], it was dhows that moved goods across the sea through it's treacherous winds. Once Europe began to control trade through the peninsula and Indian ocean, especially through the British, ports became more specialized. This meant that only certain ships could travel to certain ports, which in turn meant that certain ports could be integrated into imperial networks. [[Telecommunications]] became crucial for integration. European powers took advantage of new legal systems and variations in sovereignty and arbitrage, as well as, new monetary and credit regimes.

Different European countries would trade within the Gulf, specifically in Dubai as it was one of the few ports that were "free ports," ports that were (and still are) tax havens for goods. Till this day free ports are integral to macro-organism of the port system. Foreign businesses prefer operating in the free zone because of the political stability, access to telecommunications, transport and banking services, and the absence of taxes. The free zone also houses warehouses storing US military materiel and humanitarian organizations that increasingly use Dubai as their base of operations. 

As the British established their colonial rule in India, and especially when the [[Suez Canal]] became "theirs" to protect it's route to it's prize possession, geopolitics and politics influenced the creation and destruction of harbors and ports across the Gulf; for example, the British occupation of the port of Aden in 1839. This was not a mere coincidence but a calculated move by the British governorate of Bombay. The pretext for this occupation was an incident involving a stranded Bombay ship that was looted by locals. This incident, likely in collusion with the ship's owner for insurance takings, provided the necessary justification for British control over Aden. Similar to Aden, what shift through the 19th century and into the 20th century would be ports converting or being used for [[Militarism|militarism]] (either for it's [[Military Aid|aid]], or as a station, or for it's transportation). Some ports would be created in order to dig up new [[Oil|petroleum]] or facilitate it. In the 20th century, the mapping and construction of ports were helped or dictated by arbitration courts which help capital move.
