description: A practice, a critical study method.
title: This is a practice, a critical study method on how the world has already ended. The task is to move through and beneath the meanings of phenomena, events, and material concerns so as to explore their implications within the everyday. The necessity of this critique, to quote David Harvey, is “the epistemological underpinning for any attempt to integrate everyday material concerns into broader frameworks.”
