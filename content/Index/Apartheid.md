Apartheid has two semantic variations: one, being more propagandistic and used by conservatives, i.e, “separate development” through social, economic, and political realms. To proceed on different tracks while maintaining cultural traditions within different groups; the other variation, recognizes apartheid as an ideology, system, and legal framework which is devised to withhold progress from a targeted collective of individuals through divisions, policing, and discriminatory/unequal practices, laws, and institutions, all the while promoting and granting an advantage to settler-colonial minded individuals. Political Parties, National Press, Tech., Universities, and spaces of worship all reinforce this system. [[Military Aid]], [[Banks]], Govt. Loans, stolen land, and trade all increase the capital that makes this system available.  

Apartheid “bestows an artificial unity among non-natives who belong to a diverse linguistic and cultural background, while natives are divided among many different categories. Division is an attempt for preventing national consciousness" (Wizarat, 85).

The parliament (principle law-making body) gets empowered by passing resolutions and making laws for the purpose of strengthening Apartheid. Both the prime minister and the "minister of justice" receive considerable authority, but they also play a pivotal role in the maintenance of apartheid (crushing anti-apartheid groups, and having the police under their jurisdiction; specifically the minister of justice). “The police force … has been given very wide powers, which it has had no hesitation in exercising. It enjoys the power to arrest people on slightest suspicion and to search their possessions even without a warrant. It also has the authority to define the scope of law in some cases. In this regard mention may be made of the Anti-Terrorist Act. Under this act any person who is believed by the police to be a terrorist is taken to be one unless he can prove the contrary to the satisfaction of the police” (Ibid, 86).

Apartheid, in South Africa, had not gained national ideological recognition and a legal language until 46 years after the [[Second Boer-War]] when National parties won elections, or displaced entire governments.
	Post-WWII, in South Africa the constitution had recognized Apartheid and placed respect upon its ideology. But prior to its legal framework, apartheid, had already been apart of the cultural fabric. By the 1920s, Pass Laws, Land Acts, and Urban Area Acts had created a legal architecture under which officials, policemen, and the government could prosecute, arrest, and antagonize colored individuals who transited through white areas; as previously, it did not hold a legal language but rather a racist dogma that even then was supported by the government.  
	The Second Boer-War, which was an amalgamation of over a hundred-years worth of conflict, had cemented founding structures which would allow for the transformation of the land and governmental structures that fueled a colonial desire.
	Those who orchestrated and led parts of the Boer-War, whether foe or ally, would also work together in London to compose the [[Balfour Declaration]], and the League of Nations/British [[Mandates]]. 
In Palestine apartheid, sharing a similar narrative to South Africa, would become concretized after Naksa, but its legal and social framework has it origins pre-WWI after the Balfour Declaration, and those roots can be found spreading with the expansion of a new globalized industry in the 19th century along with the rise of zionism.
