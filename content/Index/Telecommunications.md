Before the telegraph, communication between empires was done through [[Tanker (Ships)|ships]]. Then the telegraph was invented and was crucial to the control of the colonies, between France and Algeria. The telegraph was crucial as it was able to gather intelligence from overseas and expand/project its power. It allowed for the British to consolidate their power in the regions they controlled during the 19th century. The telegraph also transmitted world markets as it was able to transmit market prices. This influenced shipping times and routes. The routes of telegraph cables then now closely mirror the pathways of fiberoptic cables. "What is most striking about the maps that chart the routes of internet cables is the extent to which the density of cable internet corresponds to the weight and volume of shipping in a given geographic area" (Khalili, 27).  Internet cables are subsidized just as heavily as imperial mail ships were.
