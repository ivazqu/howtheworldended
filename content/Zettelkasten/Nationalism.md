Nationalism in Europe and the U.S has largely been unidimensional in its focus and orientation ("one nation under....", one leader, one territory). Arab nationalism has largely been multivalent, strongly connected to Palestinian nationalism and vice-versa; a Palestinian living in Jaffa during the 19th century could have strong ties to Palestine while also having an affinity with Istanbul and Mecca. When European nations had a stronghold across the Levant, Gulf, and North Africa, Arab intellectuals began to articulate nationalist ideals and sentiments through books and journals; prior to direct [[Military Aid|militarism]], [[mandates]], and settler-colonial maneuvers, the Ottoman empire had instilled a sense of unity through the Ottoman state and the sultan (an expansive *umma*). 

Nationalism can be the organic and emotional link that is reinforced through culture, tradition, shared experiences, or common symbols, by way of nation-state building (or its processes: militarism, political ideology, institutions and their systems, etc.) and a territorial attachment. Nationalism at can also be antithetical; formed as an opposition to something, meaning that it can be awoken. 

Industrial social organization has had a huge impact on nationalism as it created a certain level homogeneity through "society and in cultural norms thus resulting in the emergence of the phenomenon of nationhood and, consequently, nationalism" (Kamrava, 68). Through industrial social organization, as well as diasporas (or [[migration|migrations]] due to war), [[music]] spread out of the levant and into other Arab ruling countries, and eventually would find it's way back into the levant. Nationalism hinged with industrial social organization led to an uneven [[cultural production]] across the Gulf, Levant, and North Africa.
