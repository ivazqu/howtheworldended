**The investment climate for capital endeavors**; for example, if a climate disaster were to occur, the neoliberal state would protect the business climate over the natural climate; favoring the integrity of the financial system over well-being. Interventions by the state are done in favor of particular business interest, and “credits are arbitrarily extended from one state to another in order to gain political access and influence in geopolitically sensitive regions (such as the middle east).” ([[Brief History of Neoliberalism]], 71)
