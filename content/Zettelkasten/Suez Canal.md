 European steam ship companies were chartering ships for pilgrimage, the opening of the Suez only accelerated the trend of buying into the business. European shipping firms controlled shipping routes for pilgrimage until airplanes had taken over and better road infrastructure was implemented (until the 50s). 56' Suez Crisis accelerated the trend out of sea transport for pilgrimage as well as decolonial struggles in the 50s and 60s which European shipping companies left with their colonial state. The construction of the Suez followed the cotton boom in Egypt in the early 1860s

"The opening of the canal encouraged the expansion of [[ports|[ports]]] Aden and Jeddah, helped Britain consolidate its imperial power, facilitated the transformation of the petroleum industry (via opening markets in the East to Azeri oil), and accelerated the expansion of extractive industries in Asia and Africa." (31)

The 56' crisis would also add fuel to the decline of Aden, and once again in 1967 due to conflicts in the region. These closures had a profound impact, intensifying anticolonial struggles and ultimately leading to the British withdrawal from Aden by the end of 1967. 

 The establishment of the People\'s Democratic Republic of Yemen (PDRY) after the British departure resulted in a devastating economic collapse in Aden. A significant portion of the workforce [[migration|migrated]] to the Gulf and East Africa, unemployment surged, and the port economy crumbled. 
 
The canal allowed for Britain to consolidate its power in Asian countries. It also deflected trade from Egypt. The British also loaned Egypt money to construct the canal. When the payment was due the British used it as an excuse along with the Urabi revolt to occupy Egypt and secure its route through the peninsula. It was also other European powers that gained access and control as well.

The canal along with other new marvelous machinery helped to move capital and empire, but it also created cyclical loops of capital movement and reproduced empire. The canal was infrastructure for further colonial extraction of commodities and the expansion of a [[globalization|global economy]]. A vast majority of the expansion was investments in mineral in Africa and Asia.

The canal also helped foster the expansion of the oil economy through the transportation of [[oil]] through steam ships. 1910, 1% of tonnage traveling through the canal was oil, by 1960 it was 82%.

The closure of the canal in 56' and 67' had impacted the transportation of oil so much that it inevitably led to VLCCs and ULCCs which traveled around the Cape of Good Hope.

A new channel was canaled in the Suez in February of 2015 and completed by August of 2016
