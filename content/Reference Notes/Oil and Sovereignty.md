# Oil and Sovereignty

## The Arab Oil Weapon

-   1859 beginning of oil production in the U.S

-   Oil was not a linear development

-   Oil as a modern developer and critique of fossil fuels that still
    exist to this day -- which the 70s proliferated

-   There was an increase fossil fuel use during the 70s, most deriving
    from the SWANA region

-   Oil became the leading commodity and delegator of world order. The
    cold war as an example amplified this

-   (not my beliefs but) Graf sees and notes Sovereignty as an authority
    outside other earthly authorities -- but post WWI it became a part
    of universal validity

    -   The decolonized other became sovereign only under recognized
        international law

    -   They would adhere to the West no matter what. (?) By the 60s
        they would demand sovereignty over their resources

    -   By 69' sovereignty becomes a myth (?)

-   The nation state could not be taken seriously. MNC superseded the
    state.

-   The state became linked with the economy. Although precariously; the
    economy is not guaranteed

-   What was at stake is/was the ability to keep goods, peoples, ideas
    out of a territory by severing its borders, but while maintaining a
    flow of goods across

-   OAPEC attempted to change international sovereignty by having
    western countries adopt foreign policies. It was believed that this
    would threaten domestic sovereignty

-   Petrol knowledge emerged out of the engineers that produced and
    extracted it

-   Oil as a weapon was not a threat as long as Saudi did not intervene
    because of their reserves (p. 89, contingency)

-   Yamani wanted Saudi to have access to U.S investments. U.S
    declined, 1972. By 73' April, Yamani shifted towards a more
    aggressive stance against the U.S. If a shortage were to occur,
    Saudi would not produce the oil. This was in meetings with Henry
    Kissinger. This was in light of the U.S's stance towards Israel.

-   By June 21, Mobil oil had printed ads for Peace in the middle east.

-   Oil was a weapon and target in connection with Arab-Israeli conflict

-   By Aug, Saudi was being watched for what it may do.

-   Sep 5, Nixon rejected Saudi's calls.

-   October 16, OAPEC meets and announces a cut in supplies.

    -   U.S denied this publicly. The white house private delegated
        contingency.

    -   The embargo was planned for 6 months, but at what point it would
        occur was unknown.

-   Amongst all Arab states oil was seen as an instrument rather a
    permanently damaging weapon

    -   See page 102 for the internal conflict for instated policies

    -   See pages 106-114 on how the embargoes shifted political
        publicity at the time

    -   Page 111, "the invisible hand does not exist"

-   The embargo was not significant because the impact was so severe,
    and some objectives were achieved. It was also not insignificant
    because there was plenty of oil and the actual goals were achieved.

## WHAT WAS THOSE GOALS? 

-   Historiographically. they changed communication and interactions on
    the international oil regime. It placed them on contingency and
    uncertainty.

-   The embargoes questioned the sovereignty of the arab states.

## Three crucial shifts

-   The oil crisis reinforced the idea that small disruptions in
    productions could severely damage economic and national security

    -   WWII, oil was focused on its military impact (supply)

    -   Oil made global interdependence ubiquitous

    -   It fed the debates on interdependence and the consequences for
        asserting National Sovereignty

        -   Led to debates on globalization

    -   Developments in energy (70s) led to environmental movements

        -   This never left or made way into political mainstream media
            till much later

    -   It demanded the idea that there is a limit to growth

-   The embargo was not random

-   The rupture led to more energy consumption and policy shifts (and
    making)

    -   Many of which were underway since the 60s

        -   The U.S began policy changes with overconsumption in the 60s

            -   By 70s the U.S was competing with Europe for M.E. Oil

    -   It's not that everything started well before, but the impact of
        the crisis must be seen as already taking place

    -   This radicalized policy changes

    -   Questioned the Global Norths sovereignty

    -   It inflated the pursuit of petrol knowledge; marrying science to
        politics
