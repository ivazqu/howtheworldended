## *Historical Preface*

-   The Anglo-Boer War in October 1899 was a building of more than a
    centuries worth of conflict, especially after the British occupation
    of the Cape from 1795 to 1803, and then from 1806 and onward.

-   The occupation was an inheritance from the Dutch, Flemish, German,
    and French, which dates back to 1652 of April, when Jan Van Riebeeck
    arrived at Table Bay in the Cape so that he could establish a
    refreshment station for the Dutch East India Company

-   A few years later he would release some workers from the company and
    allow them to settle as farmers (in order to reduce cost/make the
    company for self-sufficient)

-   This was a shift to an agrarian economy, which led to slavery and
    slaves being imported from Asia and other parts of Africa

-   The farmers that had settled did not have the capital / labour to
    cultivate crops for profit. This shifted much of their focus to
    livestock, which meant the necessity to expand beyond the Cape
    Peninsula

-   By the late 18th C., *trekboers* (white livestock-herders) had
    advanced from the winter rainfall to the summer rainfall zone. Those
    in the summer rainfall zone had existed there since the first
    millennium AD.

-   The British faced a diverse group of indigenous tribes which the
    Dutch had been facing for over a century. The Cape was primarily a
    naval base for the British into their Asian occupations, but due to
    ongoing hostilities within South Africa their naval base was
    threatened. In 1812 the British went to war with the Xhosas which
    lead to 20000 of them across the Fish River. This led to more land
    for white settlers but also population growth within the Eastern
    Province (higher land prices/labour cost)

-   In 1807, slavery was abolished in the Cape.

-   In 1828, Christian pressure led to the Ordinance 50, which granted
    servants the right to own land, and the freedom to choose employers.
    Through the British empire, slavery was abolished by 1834, and
    slaves were emancipated December 1 of that year within the Cape. By
    the end of year 12-15000 Xhosa's invaded the colony, leading to
    damages across the frontier farmers.

-   Some 15000 eastern farmers would move into the interior between the
    years 1835 to 1840. The Republic of the Orange Free State, north of
    the Orange River was established in 1854 by Voortrekkers, and the
    Zuid-Afrikaansche Republiek (ZAR) north of the Vaal River three
    years later (Transvaal)

-   In 1852 and 1854 Britain had recognized the independence of the Boer
    communities of Vaal and Orange Rivers, but the discovery of diamonds
    in 1867 changed their attitudes (in the Orange and today's Botswana
    region)

-   Britain attempted to form a single administration for southern
    Africa, under the union jack

-   Lord Carnarvon tried to annex SA in 1876 after Southern African
    states were abortive, but by 1877 Theophilus Shepstone arranged for
    the Union Jack to be raised in Pretoria in 1877 and claimed the
    whole territory for Britain (the ZAR was in financial troubles and
    the citizens were divided)

-   The first anglo-boer war took place when the Transvaal burghers
    tried to regain their independence, 1880

-   Victory led to the short lived restoration of the ZAR in 1881, but
    the mineral extraction was annexed to the Cape Colony quickly

-   In 1886 large gold deposits were found in Witwatersrand which led to
    the economy shifting to the Transvaal

-   The struggle for supremacy in region continued. In 1895 Joseph
    Chamberlain became the colonial secretary. Then Cecil John Rhodes
    tried to topple Paul Kruger from the ZAR, which ultimately failed.

-   By 1896 the conflict had escalated and both sides were purchasing
    fire arms from the Germans and French. That same year the ZAR would
    pass the Aliens Expulsion Law, Immigration Law, and the Press Law to
    limit the influence of British

-   Alfred Milner was appointed as the high commissioner for South
    Africa by Chamberlain in 1897, and Milner would take up the cause of
    the Uitlanders (foreign workers in the mineral industry)

-   In the conference in Bloemfontein, 1899, Kruger rejected the demand
    to reduce residence requirement for voting rights (14 to 5 years).
    Milner would call 10000 british troops, and Kruger would implement a
    48 hour ultimatum for the British troops to be removed from the
    border and for the reinforcements to be prevented from landing

-   Orange Free State fought with the Transvaal, in accordance to a
    treaty of 1897. The war had three phases, the republic attacked the
    british troops along the border, but reinforcements showed up, and
    Bloemfontein and Pretoria were conquered

-   The Boer Council of 1900 was the second stage where they abandoned
    large wagon laagers and fought solely with mounted commandos, which
    led to guerrilla warfare and a large battle at Dalmanutha

-   The last phase was the largest which led to more guerrilla warfare.
    Lord Roberts issued a warning that if more rail and telegraph
    connections were destroyed all houses would be burnt down. "Scorched
    Earth Policy." This rendered a number of inhabitants homeless which
    then led to the first concentration camp in 1900.

-   The war continued into 1902, with a large amount of Boer population
    joining the British\
    (as the war created divisions). The Dutch Prime Minister Abraham
    Kuyper wrote to the British govt. a mediation. Lord Kitchener who
    took over from Lord Roberts forwarded the offer to the Transvaal's
    govt., who met with their Free State counterpart, and in a war
    council they agreed to meet with Kitchener directly

## *Aftermath*

-   Louis Batha, commandant-general of the Zar burghers, spoke to troops
    *in position* about talks of peace with the British

-   Kitchner read that the British govt. would not entertain any
    proposals based on independence, at a meeting with Lord Milner and
    Botha.

-   Commandos accepted the British conditionality of a no independence
    for the republican's

-   A few days after the meeting Botha had led an attack against the
    abaQulusi (a Zulu speaking clan) who were aiding the British. The
    order was to take all food from the kraals, and the women and
    children were driven to Sikobobo's Vryheid homestead. Women were
    tortured, and animals were taken to another farm.

-   By May sixty delegates from the republics meet in Vereeniging where
    they had come to the conclusion that their men were hungry and that
    there was a threat from armed Africans.

-   The republicans wanted more money from the British for
    reconstruction (approx. £3m, no taxes implemented until a citizen
    govt. was implemented, and a willful determination against the
    Kaffir races "who were armed and taking a struggle against them."
    The destruction of wealth against those who were against them.
    31^st^ of May, peace was settled.

-   Gold and Diamonds were discovered in 1867 in Griqualand, which
    attracted immigrants, leading to a new economy and towns; railroads
    and harbors were constructed, and there was large capital
    investments in infrastructure

-   The war interrupted the Rand gold mines, and the mine owners
    implemented a decision in 1900 to lower wages to nearly in half,
    which lead to a labor exodus. Previously (1899) 96000 Africans were
    employed.

-   Kitchner used his farewell banquet "to exhort the mines to employ
    soon-to-be discharged British soldiers," which was met with favor. A
    number of jobs underground required white miners to have blasting
    certificates , but they could only be used when they had proven they
    could use rock drills (!!!!)

-   Increase the white British population in order to establish a
    British federal govt., although this failed as the region did not
    seem like a good prospect as the it was in a depression after the
    war

-   South Africa was dependent on black labor, and the dispossession of
    black labor would entail a political, social, and economic fallout
    amongst whites

-   An Intercolonial conference was held in March 1903, a proposal was
    brought to remedy the labor shortage: the importation of Asians, as
    this was the only way to get Africans to work at a lower wage

-   It was understood that whites could not compete with Africans in
    terms wages and production, but with the labor exodus, an addition
    to the labour issue was that whites would not be able to meet the
    shortfall of supplies; thus, Asian were imported

-   Eventually it was found that the importation of Asian labor was
    unprofitable as their transportation cost, meals, and recruitment
    was much higher than merely paying Africans

-   Within a few years, Chinese importation had stopped

-   Following was a report that advocated for white male suffrage with
    lower qualifications than in Britains other South African colonies,
    and a "one vote, one value" adoption

-   A new constitution was developed

-   Throughout the years 1900-1906, there was a number of uprisings and
    revolts among the Zulu speaking tribes and the whites

## *Founders*
- First by Voortrekkers in Natalia , 1839
- Britain occupied the port shortly after, 1843
- South Africa’s India indentured workers arrived in 1860 for sugar plantations, 150,000 laborers would follow for the next 5 decades
- In 1906, the Transvaal Legislative council published an ordinance where every Asian male over the age of 8 was required to carry a certificate with their finger print stamped on to it
- Asians were subjected to the same pass law that was applied non-white South African’s, the ‘Hottentot Proclamation’ of 1809, which led to Khoisan’s needed a certificate to travel from one district to another
- Ghandi arrived to South Africa in 1893 and would petition this law with Haji Ojer Ally.
- But it would come to no avail as the constitution would be passed a few days after their appeal, December 1906
- A new parliament would arise with the Boer’s in leadership (the former republic)
- In 1907, the Transvaal Parliament passed the Asiatic Law Amendment Act on 22 of March, the Transvaal British Indian assoc. and Transvaal Chinese assoc. would begin their passive resistance campaigns. Parallel movements with diff. viewpoints. Indians protested a violation of their rights, while the Chinese protested a violation in their international treaty obligations
- Enforcement of the Immigrants Restriction Law was allowed by the end of 1907, which had meant to reinforce the Registration Act, so as to prevent a cycle of catch-detain-release
- In 1906, Lord Selborne received a letter from Prime Minister of the cape colony, Leander Starr Jameson, about how it is going to be difficult to create policies over multiple regions with different systems. The Transvaal, Natal, Cape, Orange, and Rhodesia in the “Selborne Memorandum” all faced the issue of railway policy, customs, defense, mining, agriculture, Asiatic issues, and the native question. This was released by the Cape Colony in July of that year. In 1908, the conversation commenced on drafting a constitution. Rhodesia would not participate.
- In February 1909 “the convention’s agreements were first made public on 9 February with the release of a draft Act of Union, which proposed establishing a government for the Orange Free State (as the Orange River Colony would be renamed), the Cape, Natal and Transvaal under the name ‘South Africa’. The executive would be seated in Pretoria, and would consist of a governor-general appointed by the king, and ministers who would be responsible to a Cape Town–based Parliament consisting of a Senate and a House of Assembly, while there would also be an independent judiciary headed by a Supreme Court” (24).
- A contentious debate in the making of the constitution was the issue of race. For a moment, non-Europeans only formed a small portion of the electorate, but by 1882 it had jumped from 14% to 47% as the Ciskei and Transkei regions were annexed. The Registration Act of 1887 eliminated “95% of the African electorate by disenfranchising those who shared in communal or tribal occupation of property” (24). The Franchise and Ballot act of 1892 also effected Africans as it raised property qualifications and an imposition of a literacy test.
- By 1909 only 4% of cape Africans could vote, while only a total of 10.1% of the colored population counted for the entire electorate
- The former republics had a direct approach to the voting issue, only whites could vote.
- At a National Convention Merriman proposed protecting the Cape’s franchise , but it came with a lower safeguard and two stipulations : the cape could not disenfranchise any cape vote (whether it be for race or color) unless the house passed a bill with 2/3s in favor, but it also broke with Cape tradition in that, in Article 25 and 44, in order to be a member of the parliament one had to be of British European descent. The two clauses were that this law could only be repealed a by white majority parliament and an equality between English and the Dutch
- This was met with appeals by the African Political Organization, in 1909 they passed a resolution condemning the political color bar and apposed the annexation of the protectorates without consent
- They sent representatives to Britain to protest the act, which had zero impact on the National Convention
- In 1909, African and colored politicians contested the extension of the color bar into older British colonies , it was also proposed that the transfer of protectorates be done after 10 years
- The amendments did not succeed, the draft was passed unchanged in Sept. of 1909
- “The draft legislation was passed unchanged as the South Africa Act on 20 September 1909. The Times of London had reported on 29 July 1909 that  the white delegates had proposed 31 May 1910 as the date when the Union of  South Africa would come into being. The procedure they suggested was for  the governor-general to summon a South African statesman to form a cabinet, followed by elections within six months. The offer was accepted, and the new governor-general, Lord Herbert Gladstone, arrived in South Africa on 17 May 1910. Gladstone engaged various local figures before announcing on 21 May that he had invited Louis Botha to become prime minister” (27).
- In 1910 election campaigns for the parliament were held. Louis Botha and Smuts were steadfast in their mission to contest the campaign. When it came to key political issues Botha and Smuts would deny and contest the same system they had established in the Transvaal, such as children learning in their mother tongue before going into higher education where they would learn in English, or “closer settlements,” which was the name given to the assisted migration of “agricultural settlers,” which would have been unmentionable in the backveld. Both of these policies perpetuated Lord Milner’s legacy and JBM Hertzog’s policies (one of the peace negotiators at the Melrose House). Hertzog made it mandatory for students to study in only English and Dutch in the Orange River Colony. This was met with great protest, and when asked what he would do about it, he replied “nothing.”
- Of the key issues in parliament was the question of race, or the native question. Botha’s party SAP and their allied coalition SANP was an amalgam of conflicting interesting. The black vote.
- Jan Smuts, in 1911 (following a 5-6 years of worker revolts) outlined his policy of Interior Ministry towards South Africa’s Asian population. Three points: “rigidly limit further immigration; prevent Asians from capturing more of the retail trade; and restrict them to the provinces of South Africa where they were domiciled.” (36)
- The bill was introduced in 1911, but he rescinded the bill as he wanted a full and satisfactory settlement. This led to correspondences between Ghandi and Smuts, “which concluded on 22 May 1911 with an agreement that government would repeal the 1907 Registration Act and amend the Immigration Bill to incorporate the prin-ciples of legal equality and administrative inequality. The amendments would involve the bill being stripped of all passages explicitly targeting Asians, but with the understanding that racial discrimination would apply in enforcing the laws. The permissible discrimination was specified: Asians would be restricted from travelling between provinces, and no more than six would be allowed to immigrate to South Africa per year. In short, in return for the long-standing goal of repealing the Registration Act, Gandhi would approve two key pillars of Smuts’s revamped anti-Asian legislation” (36-37).
- This agreement was amended in 1913 when Smuts revamped it by prohibiting immigrants classified as anyone “who enters or is found in the Union’ whom it deemed undesirable ‘on economic grounds, or on account of standards or habits of life.”
- Soon after Indians would be arrested for crossing into the Transvaal illegally, and Ghandi would encourage Indian laborers to strike.
- Walter Rubusana would return the Cape Provincial as the representative of Tembuland, his senior position was acknowledged in May 1911 at the Third annual conference of the South African Native Convention.
- A year prior to the elections, 1909, and through two years of delegations, the South African Native Congress was established in 1911.
- “Topics discussed over the following days included recurrent panics about native risings, the ‘black’ and ‘white’ peril (referring to periodic scares among all racial groups about sexual molestation across the color line), the indiscriminate dismissal of black railway servants, and the threatened introduction of passes for women. But no subject generated as much engagement as the Squatters’ Bill then before Parliament. The bill reflected a long-standing bugbear among many white farmers who argued that the high concentration of Africans on certain properties exacerbated their labour-supply problems. The legislation sought to cap the number of tenants on farms and limit land purchases by Africans, which indicated a lurking motive to expand the pool of propertyless and therefore cheap black labor. Speakers said the bill would turn blacks into wanderers and pariahs in the land of their birth, and a deputation was appointed to wait on the minister for native affairs” (30).
- The govt. was divided on these issues, “closer settlements,” and as a response to the  Select Committee’s report on closer settlements, Hertzog in a speech asked: ‘What would these people bring you?’ Not safety, for no country was as insulated from foreign wars as South Africa; not development either, for poverty increased with the population. He concluded it would only satisfy the short-term demands of large property owners for cheap labor, while impoverishing everybody else” (31).
- “Hertzog turned to the roots of existing white poverty in a speech … He said the crux of the matter was that blacks could live on a shilling a day… he offered an interesting twist on the theory of Social Darwinism, saying: ‘The fittest will survive, but the fittest as things stand, is not the European. The fittest is the native, who can live more cheaply.’ Noting that the Chinese had been dismissed because whites could not compete with men who ‘lived on rice’, he warned these were only palliatives and a more permanent solution had to be found” (31)
- His solution since 1903 was segregation, and he was inspired by the U.S’s handling of race after the abolition.
- It was also in 1903 that the South African Native Affairs Commission advocated for segregation
- Botha himself was against segregation as he saw it as an impediment in labor, but when Botha reshuffled his cabinet in 1912, he took Hertzog off as the Native Affairs Minister, and put J.W Sauer in place, and thus in charge of the native question.
- “Part of the appeal of Hertzog’s proposal was its reconciliation of Boer and British traditions, in keeping with the spirit of the times.”
- Hertzog was so wild that even the conservative cabinet he was working for, they could not accept his speeches or claims, so much so that Botha had to reform a new cabinet.
- Sauer reshuffled
- In 1913 Sauer had made it a point in a speech that Natives were purchasing land a too high of a rate, and he believed something should have been done about that. This had renewed the debates around the Squattors bill which the govt. had previously declared unlawful.
- Hertzog as PM, his party would adopt a pro-Zionist declaration in 1926.
- “It might be that they came in an abject condiction but it must be remembered that that was due to their environment and ... they always paid great attention to the education and improvement of their children who would be the Spinozas and Maimonides of the future. We must accord a hearty welcome to all white people who would help to build up the future of South Africa” in a speech in 1909 to the Seventh Annual Dinner of the Rand Pioneers Johannesburg.
- At the break of WW1, South Africa captures Germanies South West Africa at the bequest of the British govt.
- After Louis Botha captured SWA, he offered to the British Govt. their army, to which they accepted, but their troops were reoriented and dispatched to the Sinai
- “South African troops were involved in further Middle East fighting dur-ing 1917, in operations that were intended to be a counterpart to the earlier  campaign against the Senussi. The aim of the new drive was to secure the Suez Canal from the east. This would involve capturing Palestine, which  could then be used as a springboard for the invasion of Syria. Six hundred and seventy members of the South African Field Artillery left Potchefstroom in July and sailed from Durban to the Middle East, where they joined the Egyptian Expeditionary Force commanded by the British general Edmund Allenby. The campaign was launched on 27 October, and by early November the Ottoman army was in headlong retreat towards Jerusalem, which was  taken on 9 December, 1917” (51).
- At the end of WW1 East Africa had the highest non-battle to battle casualties, 31.40 to 1, and the second highest was in Mesopotamia 20.25 to 1.
## Revolt
- Moffat commission in 1918 did not take the ISL's efforts to mobilize African's seriously; it correlated the education of African's to a willful ignorance "The so called education of natives in their present state of mental development in the doctrines of Socialism can only be likened to teaching children to play with matches round an open barrel of gunpowder and leading them to believe that the inevitable explosion will destroy everyone but themselves. (63)"
- SAANC had pursued, again, another effort to increase wages for Black workers and equal rights. This would would be met with nothing except a "message" to their representations in govt. They had reported their efforts back to their multiracial gathering in Johannesburg which was met with nothing but anger, and speakers would attribute the issue with poverty with the past system of South Africa as well as slavery. That same year a 1000 blacks would meet at the "Pass Office" to remove the Pass Law, but this too was met with nothing but antagonism; police assaulted women and arrested numerous individuals. More protest and more arrest ensued, and the Pass Law was accepted after a meeting with the SAANC in July.
- Following the protest of the Pass Law, a series of several strikes occurred throughout the mines in South Africa. Over 40000 black bodies had gathered in a strike against their unfair compensation rates. The strikes were met with heavy policing, and one of them had broken the gathering into disarray; leading the workers into white neighborhoods, which was met with the home owners guns.
- "the ferment of 1918–1920 served as an important bellwether for black popular politics, in terms of the use of mass action in the forms of passive resistance and general strikes to support constitutional and socio-economic demands" (65).
- The National Parties in 1919 had gathered in congress to petition to the British govt. for a republic, but this was ultimately rejected by Lloyd George (J.B.M Hertzog brought the petition to London). That same year the Treaty of Versailles was signed; Germany would lose it's overseas territories; and South Africa would be granted a "C Mandate" which granted them the ability to govern South-West Africa. 
- Shortly after, a South African deputation traveled to London to petition the issue of passes to Lloyd George, who in response only gave them the assurance that he will pass their message to Smuts (who succeeded Louis Botha after his death). George also mentioned that legal issues within South Africa could only be solved within South Africa. Smuts, after winning elections, would address the issue not be solving it, but by reworking how the mechanisms of the "passes" would function within the urban segregation; meaning, the Land Act which had separated white neighborhoods from colored neighborhoods would be subsumed under the Native Affairs Bill (introduced by the Parliament) which would make every town establish a areas upon which the (colored) employed could migrate through (this was the Urban Areas Act).
	- divide and conquer is the mission of colonialism and it's settlements
- By 1920, increasing black protest was met with lethal force by whites - both civilians and officials, but the protest had began to take a different form from that which occurred previously, instead of resisting white colonial tactics, they had abandoned the struggle for equality within the framework of a united South Africa (? maybe they wanted their own sovereignty?)
- A communist (Bolshevik) union had formed, with its beginnings dating back to 1905 and trip to Russia around that period, through a series of strikes, and unions forming, a mounting revolt had commenced by the 1920s which led to police being killed and the military being called in to murder its own civilians; the strike was an effort to establish a party that recognized a new union and also an increase in wages; a small battle was held which led to deaths of hundreds and bombs being dropped over neighborhoods; those who led the strike would ultimately end it after the military had scorched the earth and rendered their mobility abysmal. Strikers would ultimately return to work with lower wages. (See pages 72-76).
