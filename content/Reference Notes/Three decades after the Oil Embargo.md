# Three Decades after the Oil Embargo

-   A number of Arab oil producing countries used oil as a political
    weapon in 56', 67', 73,

-   In 67' and 73' their objective was to target countries that that
    supported Israel

-   73' was one of the most significant embargoes

-   Several Arab writers have classified the oil embargo as a weapon
    since the 40s. Even more so after 48'. After the establishment of
    Israel

    -   Halted imports from Iraq in Haifa port

-   Syria was one of the first countries to protest. They did not sign
    the Topline Pipeline with the U.S; in protest of partitioning
    Palestine

## Each embargo shared 3 things

1.  War set off each embargo

2.  Each embargo was an attempt towards a political goal

3.  Egypt shut down the Suez Canal which forced oil tankers to go around
    Africa's Cape of Good Hope (for U.S and E.U deliveries)

4.  The Arab public supported the embargo

5.  The media played a role in igniting the embargoes

-   The succeeded in propaganda for domestic consumption

-   Misrepresentation of the oil embargo meant that others could occur
    if they were believed to be successful

-   56' Embargo had little to no impact

## 

## 67' Embargo

-   Algeria, Egypt, Iraq, Syria all called for a halt in all Arab oil
    production

    -   Saudi, Libya, and Kuwait opposed it

        -   In response to war that the U.S, GB, and Germany supported

-   The embargo halted out economic and war fears

-   Saudi only reluctantly participated by pressure from Nasser

-   The embargoes could be seen as failures since Israel was still being
    supplied by opposed nations

-   The 67' embargo helped domestic pressures

## 73' Embargo

-   Several Arab states produced embargoes on U.S, Neth., and Denmark
    for their support of Israel. October 73'

-   OAPEC used embargoes / productions cuts to pressure U.S.

    -   In hopes of an even handed policy

    -   Wanted resolution 242 and Israel to withdraw to Pre-June 5, 67'

## OAPEC was established in 68' due to previous failed embargoes 

-   The 2004 embargo is not considered "political"

-   Kuwait called OAPEC to meet in order to support Egypt and Syria. All
    countries agreed, except Iraq, to cut supplies by 5%

    -   Iraq's opposition caused another council to form: Conference of
        Arab Oil Ministers

        -   Iraq wanted a full withdrawal

-   Saudi wanted to the 5% to be a recommendation. They signaled to the
    U.S that this would happen, Nixon rejected the idea. Saudi joined
    the embargo.

    -   Saudi was concerned that high oil prices would destroy the EU
        economies and strengthen the communist economies

    -   October 73', Saudi demanded full withdrawal of Israel and 242 be
        isolated

-   This was a total embargo against the U.S. 10% against other enemies.

    -   West Germany, G.B, and Scandinavians were highly dependent on
        imports from the Netherlands

-   The minimal withdrawal of Israel led to a softening of the embargoes
    (intended)

    -   March 18, 74' U.S, July 11, 74' Neth.

## Why 73' was unique

-   Oil prices did not fall after and they were significantly more than
    in 56' and 67'

-   In tandem with recessions, inflation, and unemployment

-   Oil producing countries received a lot of wealth during this period

-   The embargoes only last for two months, but the policies and effects
    have lasted till this day

The embargo was only one of many reasons why gas prices rose, others
include:

-   Production cuts

-   Excess capacity: the cut was greater than the excess which targeted
    countries had. Other countries increased their production.

    -   Excess was declining globally. Most of the excess was in OAPEC.
        By 70' the U.S supply and demand was also greater

-   OAPEC gained more control of oil by the govt. ties

-   Speculation led to stocks becoming unavailable because of the fear
    of the future. There was oil, but investors feared there wouldn't be
    any

-   Transportation of oil

High oil prices and embargoes led to inflation. Investments in
commodities and oil became the move. It made buying oil profitable.
Either for accumulation or for resale later. *Speculation*.

This allowed for hoarding, this raised the demand for oil and caused
shortages and prevented prices from declining.

Gulf states increased prices October 16, 73'. OAPEC adopted cuts 17^th^.
By the 19^th^ embargoes had been placed.
