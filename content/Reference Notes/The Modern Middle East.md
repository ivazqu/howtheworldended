## Introduction
- This books examines the *political* history of the Middle East, the language, religion, and ethnicity, which at times has become the force for conflict and division; subtle differences have served as the crux for defining nationality and subnationality, for those loyal and for political mobilization. This book attempts to give a brief examination of the "modern" history of the Middle East, but it does fail at not generalizing, as the history of the Middle East is far greater than what one book can cover, especially within the differences that do exist. The book briefly covers the beginning of Islam up to the Ottoman empire, and then it begins to cover the Middle East that we are familiar with; that being, the Middle East after the Balfour Declaration. 
- *Maghreb* signifies the occident, West of Egypt
- Submission (*Islam*) to God (*Allah*)

- Chapter 1, Islam to the Ottoman empire.
- "Politics and history are both dynamic and changeable processes" (4).
- "The present manifestation of the Palestinian-Israeli conﬂict resulted from the outcome of the Arab-Israeli wars, which were a product of competing varieties of nationalism, shaped by the machinations of Western colonial powers, who had gone to the Mid-dle East once the Ottomans collapsed, and so on. The same line of inquiry could be applied to current state-society relations in the Middle East or to each country’s level of economic development" (ibid).

- Chapter 7, Palestinian-Israeli conflict. 
- Chapter 8, examines three features of the political economy of the Middle East: the role of the state (and how far it spreads); "it's pursuit of economic policies designed to minimize its extractive role in relation to social actors;" and it's limits in controlling economic activity or regulate them.

## Chapter 1 and Part 1 introduction, *A political history of the Middle East* and *From Islam to the Great War*
- The Ottoman empire, which began its rule over much of the Middle East in the late 15th and 16th century, united a large portion of the varied lands under its imperial "banner," but their control was more tenuous and indirect; the Ottoman "'state'" operated mainly in Istanbul and the Anatolian regions; it had implemented *beyliks* (provincial governorships servicing the Ottoman court); but its rule rarely reach deep within the societies. The collapse of the Ottoman empire inaugurated European colonialism, which had not completely left until about the 1970s. The top-down flow of power, detachment, and minimal contact still persisted after the collapse of the Ottoman empire.
- See pages 9 and 10 for a brief account of the ancient civilizations that ruled and remained within the Mesopotamian region. 
- When Islam first began to emerge the two predominant groups within the region were the Byzantines and the Sassanids, which both had adopted monotheistic religions: Christianity and Zoroastrianism (respectively); several other forms of Christianity sprouted elsewhere within the Middle East. Parts of Iraq were Zoroastrian, and most of Iran, it had only died till after the time of the Arab conquest.
- Places of worship from the early Christian, pre-christian, and zoroastrian communities were spaces for local organization and mobilization. Religion was also used as a tool or manipulative tactic for political leaders (Constantinople/Istanbul for example). There are three interrelated communities that made a majority of the civilian life: urban communities, cities that established and dominated markets and money economies, political and administrative systems were set-up, religious power/authority, and liturgy/customs had evolved. 
- Cities throughout the Middle East can be divided between pre-Islamic and Islamaic ones. 
- Many cities were destroyed or evolved during the expansion of Islam, some became Military encampments. Yathrib became Medina. 
- Small isolated villages and Bedouins were also apart of the communities within the Middle East (developed around the Neolithic Revolution 6000 B.C., also when new agriculture and the domestication of animals evolved). 
- Islam was a mainly an urban religion. 
- Bedouins found it much more secure to migrate as small town economic insecurities would prevail as some urban areas were less settled. It was also dependent on the seasons and nature. 
- The change in city powers, and imperial power, also changed the movement of populations. 
- A large majority of Middle Eastern civilians lived in villages, and until the late 20th century, more than 40 percent still dwelled within villages/tribal communities. In spite of the urban development consisting of a 4-5% increase year between 1980 to 1995. 
- Mecca was a site of pilgrimage; it is believed to house the shrine Ka'ba, where Abraham performed his sacrifice; it is also the site of a lucrative trade for incense between Yemen and Syria; it is believed that the city had the ability to control surrounding camal-breeding tribes, who could supply transportation and raid caravans, it is believed that Meccan's controlled these tribes and managed their trade, which made the city of Mecca so important. 
- Muhammad belonged to a Quraysh tribe, who would dominate the city approximately a century earlier.
	- Muhammad lost his parents at a young age, married an older woman and remained faithful to her after her death.
	- Only his daughters survived out of his children. 
- "Disenchanted with the paganism of fellow Meccans, in 610 A.D., during one of his frequent visits to the nearby Mount Hira, Muhammad was visited by the archangel Gabriel and given the command to recite (*iqra* in Arabic) what was to become verse 1 of chapter (*surah*) 96 of the Quran (recitations): “Recite in the name of your Lord who created.” God (*Lah*), Muham-mad was told, was one (*Al-Lah*, the God), and man must submit to his will. Life was to be reordered on the basis of submission (*islam*) to God" (14).
- Muhammad left Mecca around 622 A.D (*Hijrah*, approximately 10 years after he began to openly call for followers. He was invited to Yathrib by the cities notables, and there he established a new calendar year (lunar, after his *Hijrah*, thus A.H).
- Islam had challenged the core principles of the established religion within the region, it was disruptive to the economy and social life at the time, especially as it was rooted in kinship and tribal affiliation, which determined everything from security to social and economic statuses. Then there was a three main gods, Lat, Manat, and Uzza. 
- Muhammad and his followers, Mecca emigrants (Muhajerun), established a series of treaties in Medina (which had gained political and military power) where the Meccan's and those that lived in Yathrib would live in peace and be one community (*umma*) - maintaining customs and laws, and bringing disputes to Muhammad. These agreements are some of the oldest constitutions in the Middle East. 
	- apart of the constitutions was thirty articles, amongst those articles was the protection of Jews.
- Some of the legal foundations of the *umma* were written into the Quran.
	- "The Quran is not a “legislative document” in that it does not outline the features of an incipient Islamic political order. Instead, it includes various detailed pronouncements on proper conduct and social relations, including inheritance laws, marital relations, relations with non-Muslims, and punishments for crimes such as theft and adultery" (16).
- After the prophets death, there were three additional Islamic jurisprdence: the Sunna (a collection of the prophets way of life "the perfect form of behavior"); *ijma* (consensus); and *qiyas* (analogical reasoning?); which all together formed the four (with the Quaran) foundations of *sharia* (Islamic law, or the principles of a total way of life).
- 114 *surahs*, 88 in Mecca, and 26 in Medina.
- The current Quran is based on how the prophet recited the verses during Ramadan, not by chronological order, this version was amended in the third caliph Uthman from 644 to 655 A.D.
- There is no evidence that the Quran was used for political motivations but it does hold power in how it can activate politics through its communal activities. 
- "Each pillar has a strong communal aspect: communal prayers in mosques on Fridays, a day whose Arabic translation, jum‘ah, means “community” or “congregation”; the rituals attached to fasting in the month of Ramadan; the economic and ﬁnancial obligation to support the community through tithes; the ritual pilgrimage to Mecca, the hajj, in conjunction with other believers; and the profession of faith by reciting the same, brief Quranic verse" (17).
- The next 70 years after the prophets death, Islam had expanded to capture all of North Africa, much of central Asia, and parts of southern Spain. By the 8th century, it had reached as far as western China.
- A number of division arose after his death, especially with the large expansion of the empire; Shi'ites (partisans) and Sunnis (traditionalist) arose out of disagreements between succession, land, taxes, and more. Shi'ites believed in blood succession (Ali to be the successor), while the Sunnis believed in Uthman's cousin and the governor of Damascus (who declared himself the caliph).
- After Ali died, the caliphate seat moved from Medina to Damascus, and there a Umayyad caliphate established a rule which would last until 750. 
	- "The Umayyads established a centralized, de facto dynasty, initiated administrative measures for running their expanding domain, issued gold and silver coins (the dinar and the dirham, respec-tively), introduced ﬁscal reforms and institutionalized tax collection, and signiﬁcantly added to the size of the territory under their control" (19).
- There was an issue of non-muslims and recent converts. See page 19. 
- History of Islam and Caliphates to the Ottoman empire on pages 20-28.
- Ottoman empire can be defined in three stages: it rise and superiority, its parity in the 17th and 18th centuries, and its eventual decline. 
	- Egypt had parted ways with the Ottoman empire around the late 18th century. This dynasty had lasted until the mid-20th century.
- The Tanzimat (Ottoman) had saw the introduction of the telegraph, steamship, postal system, and railway constructions (mid-19th century)
	- "These and other changes had slowly engendered the rise of new classes of articulate modernists. By far the most important of these were two generations of Ottoman subjects, the so-called “Young Ottomans,” who came to prominence around 1867, and the “Young Turks,” who in July 1908 spearheaded a revolution of sorts by forcing the sultan to rein-state the long-suspended constitution of 1876. Inspired by the political ideals prevalent in Europe and dazzled by the industrial accomplishments of Britain, yet remaining committed to their Islamic religion and Ottoman heritage, both groups sought to reform the system from within. With their attempts at turning the dynasty into a constitutional parliamentary system, presumably along the Westminster model, they gave rise to a number of different, competing factions. By the early years of the twentieth century, the idea of a multinational, multireligious empire had become increasingly untenable, and the birth of local national identities and loyalties was tearing the empire apart. This problem was not unique to the Ottoman Empire. At about roughly the same time, the two other dynasties bordering the Ottomans, the Hapsburgs to the west and the Qajars to the east, also faced crises that threatened their very survival, eventually leading to their collapse" (27).
- "The death of the Ottomans took a few, painful years. The empire reluctantly entered the war on Germany’s side at the beginning of the Great War. Britain and its allies in turn decided to chip away at the Ottomans’ Middle Eastern provinces. Russian advances in Anatolia were halted only after the 1917 communist revolution. That same year Britain captured Baghdad, and Jerusalem fell a year later. A rebellion calling for independence also broke out among the Arab population of the Hijaz. The Ottoman Empire was being systematically dismembered" (28).
- Iran's conversion on 29.
- Iran was taking concessions during the 19th century, and at point had taken a massive loan from the Russian's so that they (Qajars) can tour Europe. The Qajars were working with the British in the 19th century. 
	- After losing wars to Russia, the British would take concessions so as to secure land 
		- 1863, telegraphs line
		- 1872, mining
		- 1889, tobacco
	- Qajars would lose their seat on the throne after 1921 with Reza's military coup
- The foreign economic dominance, institutional decays, and royal despotism led to Iran's Constitutional Revolution, from 1905 to 19011.
	- "It involved three principal elements in Iranian society: the *ulama*, some of whom were procourt but many of whom favored limitations on the arbitrary powers of the monarch; the merchants, whose opposition was inspired by their organic links with the *ulama* and their resentment toward foreign concessions; and a small cadre of educated intellectuals, who were heartened by the success of the constitutionalists in Istanbul and the European phenomenon of limited, parliamentary monarchy" (31).
		- Notably in this equation is the *'ayan* who were allies of the *ulama* (merchant class)
	- They were divided on the house of justice (Edalat Khaneh) and a parliament (Majles)
		- Muzafar al-Din Shah only signed the constitution on his death bed
	- By the time of Ahmad Shah, the countries borders and domestic control was out of their hands. Russia and the British controlled the economy, and tribal chieftains controlled the domestic. 
	- The "revolution" may not be regarded as a revolution, and it is not clear as to whether those who had begun the process would consider a revolution to begin with; they had failed to be "compliant with traditional notions of justice (*'edalat*) and freedom from tyranny (*zulm*)", but what did occur was a number of local associations (*anjomans*), which is a number of appointed representatives within the Majles (this would only contribute to the countries "administrative paralysis").
		- some would see this as an important step to lessen the powers of a monarchy
		- after WWII, the lessening of the monarchies powers grew, making the Majles more powerful
			- This would fuel the Islamic revolution of 78'-79'
- Across the Middle East "the ensuing problems of economic underdevelopment and skewed political institutionalization would only become magniﬁed in the twentieth century" (34).
## Chapter 2, From territories to independent states
- The end of the Ottoman empire was also the end of the caliphal rule
- 1918 to 1939 created a momentous shift in the Middle East, more expansively, between 1895 to the 1940s.
- The ghost of the past still roams
- One of the primary concerns of the British was India, their crown jewel. The British would make sure, that within the power vacuum in which the Ottomans left, the rivalries, competing borders, and political actors, that they remained secure in their interest and access to India.
	- Much of the British Middle East policy relied on their defense of the Suez. 
		- 1956 would change this
		- The battles in Jordan and Palestine were primarily dependent on this fact
			- in Palestine they intervened directly, although their policies were confused and contradictory at best
			- "In Transjordan, they oversaw the creation of a nominally independent country over whose foreign policy, economy, and military they retained control" (37).
- Another concern was their access to the newly discovered oil fields, and lastly the partitioning of the lands after the collapse of the Ottoman empire.
- "Britain... embarked on a series of historic diplomatic initiatives, the most important of which were the Hussein-McMahon Correspondence, the Sykes-Picot Agreement, and the Balfour Declaration" (37).
- France had similar, but unclear, motives that were based on their protection of Christians within the Levant and competition against other European powers.
	- "As far as competition with its European neighbors was concerned, France was alarmed—as was Britain—by the German con-struction of the Baghdad Railway beginning in 1903. The attempt to ﬁnance and build a competing railway from Syria to Baghdad was representative of this competition" (ibid).
- Most of their interest relied on commercial investments. France held 60% of Ottoman loans, Germany 21%, and the British 14%
- France and Britain would work together rather than go to war with one another in their agreements. In 1904 they signed the Entente Cordial: France was given Morocco, and the British were given Egypt.
	- Frances invasions into Tunisia and Algeria was based on their imperial desire, rather than a commercial necessity
- "the French and British carved up the Asiatic Ottoman territories in the Sykes-Picot Agreement, Mesopotamia (Iraq), Arabia, and Palestine became British protectorates, while the Syrian and Lebanese protectorates went to the French. As for the Maghreb, which the French had generally come to consider not as colonies but rather as provinces linked to the mother country, independence had to come through warfare" (38).
- Atatürk, Reza, and Muhammad V (Morocco), and Habib Bourguiba (Tunisia), were politcal figures that "attempted" to reverse course on colonial powers. Ibn Saud would collaborate with the British and French. 
- Three important interrelated developments occurred as well: First, the revolt against Ottoman rule in 1916; beginning in the Hijaz, a short dynasty in Syria, and the monarchy in Iraq; all a product of communications between Sharif Hussein in Mecca and Sir Henry McMahon (the British commissioner). This communication also created the product we know as the allocation of colonial territories, the second development, signed through a numerous amount of bilateral and multilateral treaties: Sykes-Picot Agreement (May 1916), the Balfour Declaration (November 1917), the Conference of San Remo (April 1920), and the Treaty of Sèvres (August 1920). Lastly, the birth of Turkey, Palestine, Syria, Lebanon, Transjordan, Iraq, and Saudi Arabia. 
- the Arab revolt is important because it spawned countries as well as close relationships to the British 
	- which prompted them to secure the assets and interest during and after the first World War, especially after the Ottomans declared war on the allied powers; the British needed control from within. Hussein ibn Ali would become important for the British
- Hussein and McMahon would arrange a series of agreements for land
	- Hussein declared himself ruler of the Hijaz (1916)
		- T.E. Lawrence became infamous through his military adventures
	- Faisal, Hussein's son, declared himself ruler over Syria (1918)
- 1916 Pico-Sykes Agreement, divided much of the Middle East
	- Italy and Russia were excluded after the October 1917 revolution
- Faisal was dethroned in Syria, and implemented by the British in Iraq in 1921
- His Brother was placed in Transjordan, Abdullah
- Hashemites were in control of three countries, Hijaz, Jordan, and Iraq
- Hijaz would fall to Saud in 1924
- Iraq fell to the Arab revolution in 58'
- the Balfour declaration, an attempt to appease both the Americans and the Russians, as well as their jewish population 
	- "British policy makers appear to have genuinely thought that they could solve the historic problems of the Jews once and for all and attend to the ensuing problems of the Arabs as well, while at the same time furthering Britain’s imperial interests" (43).
- the Treaty of Sèvres solidified much of the Sykes-Pico agreement
- Egypt's colonial rule on page 46, as well as, Maghreb 
- "The 1930s, by contrast, were marked less by international changes, at least in the Middle East, than by a consolidation of the domestic political dynamics set in motion in the 1920s. Of the countries of the Middle East, Transjordan, Syria, and Lebanon did not necessarily experience signiﬁcant changes, remaining mandatory territories and becoming independent only in the 1940s. Egypt also remained in a state of semicolonial submission to Britain, and the Egyptian world would not be turned upside down by Nasserism until after 1952. But far-reaching changes were fundamentally altering the social and political landscape of Turkey, Iran, Palestine, and the Arabian peninsula. Turkey and Iran became dominated by men who strongly advocated what may be labeled statist modernism: using the apparatus of the state, at times repressively, to impose modernization on their countries. Palestine was overcome by Zionism, and any doubts as to whether European Jews needed a distant Zion were settled by the madness of Nazi fascism. Arabia, ﬁnally, was taken over by the Saudis, a puritanical clan of warriors from the central Najd region. The Kingdom of Hijaz ceased to exist. In its place was born the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia" (50-51).

## Chapter 3, Age of Nationalism
- [[Nationalism]] pages 67 through 72
- Zionism and the Birth of Israel, pages 72 through 83
- Palestinian nationalism
	- Has largely always been formed/forming, but its "modern" form becomes concretized in the early 20th century through the Arab Revolt and after Nakba. 
	- Shortly before the Ottoman empire was dismantled, the Sultan was forced into convening a parliament for the various provinces (*velayats*) - this had heightened local sentiments around nationalism. When print capitalism spread, a number of cultural leaders had expanded the influence of a common identity - this was heightened through the influx of zionist settlers within Palestine. 
	- Arab revolt, pages 86 and 87

- This post-1948 nationalism had three principal features. First, it was closely equated with “modernity,” seeking to rid itself of archaic, feudal traditions. Second, it was militaristic, seeing military might and discipline as immediate remedies for the defeat. Third, it saw strength in numbers, assuming that with unity the Arabs would become a force hard to defeat.
- Gamal Abdel Nasser was born in a moment of political strife in Egypt, and had entered the military when the monarchy and the British were being attacked
	- by 1952, Nasser had quickly run up the ranks of the army and was Lieutenant Colonel.
	- In 1949, he helped organize the Free Officers, a group who were intent on capturing political power
