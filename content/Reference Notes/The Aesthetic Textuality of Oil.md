# The Aesthetic Textuality of Oil

-   Edward Burtynsky photographs and documents "Oil culture" around the
    U.S. as a sign/source of freedom

-   The aesthetic textuality of oil is an essay on the oil impact on
    cultural production and the development of oil-bound social
    formations and habits

-   Oil encourages the production of a multilayered environment that
    discourages an outside that can be materialized through the
    imaginary

-   LeMenager's book *Oil* was reliant upon the oil industry -- most
    books travel thousands if not hundreds of thousands of miles through
    trains, air, and trucks. The ink used to print books are made of
    petroleum based resins, the electric that ran the machines most
    likely ran on oil, etc. Even waste falls into the barrel of oil.

-   Waste is required in order for waste to persist

-   "Petrocriticism vivifies the total, unbreakable hold of fossil fuels
    on media at every level: production, distribution, consumption, and
    waste." (64)

-   The aesthetic of oil encompasses everything - they provide a basis
    for artistic production

-   *Can we get outside of the oil relation?*

-   Oil was discovered in 1858 in Petrolia, ON. Its first successive
    drilling was in 1859 in Titusville, PA.

-   Landscapes in North America are bound to oil and they exist in
    relation to colonial and capital expansion (exploration) and
    extraction within and without them (as in the Gulf, Newfoundland,
    etc.)

-   Oil throughout the 20^th^ and 21^st^ century led to the
    redevelopment, redistribution, and reshaping of land and social
    relations

-   See *Cities of Salt*

    -   Amitav Ghosh, after encountering *Cities of Salt*, creates the
        term petrofiction for the novels tracing of capitalist labor
        practices, the development of an oil industry, and the encounter
        of U.S and European practices

-   Oil presents a clearly imagined future

-   The aesthetics of oil may at times offer a glimpse into how one
    understands their own connections to fossil fuels

-   Read *The Oil Road*

-   "Carbon Web" : the institutions, universities, militaries, banks,
    NGOs, engineering companies, legal firms, and cultural institutions
    that enable the oil corporations to conduct their business; a
    network of bodies (70)

    -   Bares resemblance to Marxist descriptions of economic base

-   The Oil Road describes the struggle in how oil moves, it is a
    travelogue of an oil pipeline. The authors Marriot and
    Minio-Paluello offer a strategy in countering the development of
    infrastructure: be ahead of the plan (contingency and speculation)

-   The importance of looking at the maps provided by Marriot and
    Minio-Paluello is that it offers a chance to connect them to
    actually political struggles rather than mapping the map that has
    been mapped.
