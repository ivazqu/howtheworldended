# (1) The Balfour Declaration and the Palestine Mandate, 1917 -1923: British Imperialist Imperatives

-   The Balfour Declaration is set around the anxieties of the security
    of Suez Canal and the British military power bases east of the canal

-   1917 initiatives were imperative for the annexation of Palestine, by
    the Georg Lloyd Coalition. The essential precondition for Zionist
    for the declaration of Israel.

-   They were brought up 1923 when the new conservative admin. accepted
    this change, as the Zionist would be useful to the influence of the
    British in the mid-east, although it would prove to be the profound
    weakness of the British in the mid-east. It was proven to be
    delusional.

-   "Britain's Balfour policy, historically regressive and historically
    improbably, was dependent on a highly fortuitous combination of
    war-related circumstances. Such emphasis on contingency does not
    preclude the power of motivational forces -- these as it were,
    squeezing through the tight windows of opportunity presented by the
    first WW, and continuing, with longer-term perspective, to determine
    appraisals in the year immediately following"

-   The declaration was made under the context global economic and
    military anxieties

-   1917, 1918, and 1923 must be viewed as different takes on the
    mandate.

-   The coalition that took over after Georg had entertained serious
    doubts on the value of the declaration

-   "The Zionist policy is an unpopular one"

-   Lord Curzon was anti-zionist, he felt as though the declaration and
    mandate were foolish

-   The 1917 declaration was propaganda: the desire to activate war-time
    support within allied nations, in the hopes that Jews would pressure
    their home govts. in the struggle to defeat central powers.

-   Segev writes that the declaration "was the product of neither
    military nor diplomatic interest but of prejudice, faith, and
    sleight of hand. The men who wrote the declaration were Christian
    and Zionist and, in many cases, anti-semitic, They believed the Jews
    controlled the world."

-   There was no need to annex Palestine for the British influence. The
    declaration was fixed upon the restoration of national life in
    Palestine. But the war that brought the Zionist commitment was in
    large part a war between European empires, with the British
    concerned over the colonies.

-   Peel 1920 and Haycraft 1921 took issue with the Zionist presumptions

-   Sahar Huneidi, in 1998 makes note on how between the years 1917 to
    1922, the British govt. could have reversed the declaration, but
    they felt as though they needed to honor it still

-   Churchill and Sir John Shuckburgh were influenced by Chaim Weizmann

-   The British annexation of Palestine was a defensive military move
    that predates 1917. The British were moving eastwards of the Suez
    in 1916. The annexation was not directly correlated with
    Zionisation. Zionisation was reliant upon the annexation although.
    The declaration was a territorial formulation, and the continual
    annexation was fueled by Zionism.

-   After the collapse of the ottoman empire, it felt more urgent to
    break apart the middle east than to break apart Africa.

-   Apart of the declarations concern was its access to East Asia,
    India, and East Africa

-   Similarly, there was a heft amount of discussion of a railway
    between Palestine and the Persian Gulf

-   "Palestine, and in particular the southern Judean highlands,
    occupied a vital strategic position by the exposed eastern flank of
    the Canal-what Barbara Tuchman recognises as its \'fatal
    geography\'. The Manchester Guardian journalist and Zionist
    supporter Herbert Sidebotham considered this an age-old predicament,
    Palestine \'in Biblical history\' being \'the Belgium of the ancient
    world\', situated as it was between the rival empires of the Nile
    and Mesopotamia, its possession \'most desirable for any power that
    is responsible for the defence of Egypt\'. Whoever controlled the
    territory in the twentieth century, the persistent anxiety ran,
    could gravely compromise British imperial control in India" (237)

-   There were threats the British power from Germany, France, and
    Russia. Germany had cause alarm in Britain after their project of a
    Berlin-Baghdad project commenced in 1903, and "its eagerness to stir
    jihadi unrest amongst British Muslim subjects in Asia."

-   In 1915-1916 Turkish-German forces were able to cross the Sinai and
    attack the Suez (with no success). The British came to the conlusion
    to secure the Suez and India was strategically possession themselves
    amongst the Judean Hills and Beersheba. This was brought in war
    cabinet meetings in 1916-1917, and it was also apart of the
    British/French partitioning; where the British kept the French
    strategically away from Egypt.

-   India was a powerful military and economic asset for the British.
    But Imperialism was not a positive confident march, it was an
    anxious, negative, defensive, and reflexive to threats to its power.

-   British India concerns were reflected across the Mesopotamian,
    Levantine, and South African regions. The British were ignorant of
    Palestine. They did not know why it was actually important to the
    British. In a postwar cabinet meeting in 1915 they had considered
    Egypt and the Suez to territorial options for the British. In 1916,
    Curzon and Andrew Bonar Law were clear on their imperial motives,
    and four months prior to the declaration had made the claim that
    Palestine was important for the British, as it served as a buffer
    zone for the Suez.

-   Egypt and Turkish arms, and India.

-   There views were shared with (antagonist of the Boer War) Alfred
    Milner, and Jan Smuts (South African PM).

-   Milner was an imperialist through and through. In 1918 to 1921 he
    had become a member of the War Cabinet, and a colonial secretary and
    secretary, with a role in preparing the Balfour Declaration. In 1915
    he received a copy of the memorandum from Herbet Samuel, and was
    persuaded in the annexation of Palestine.

-   "Smuts had believed that Palestine was essential on the grounds of
    strategy and imperial communications. Any other power in control
    would constitute a serious menace to British imperial
    communications, as he told Curzon."

-   Churchill with assume responsibility of Palestine in 1921 and
    declared in the house of commons:

-   Lloyd George was more sympathetic towards Zionism than the security
    of the empire

-   George was concerned with Palestine as he felt the French would
    claim it as under the ottoman rule it was considered to be Syria.
    But this came from the influence of his younger staff, the "garden
    suburb:" Leo Amery, Sir Mark Sykes, and Philip Kerr who had served
    in South Africa under Alfred Milner between 1905-1910, as a member
    of "Milner's Kindergarten," a group of young *soi-disant*
    "reformist" imperialist.

-   Another influence was Herbert Sidebotham who was a Zionist
    journalist.

-   "The conquest of Palestine was the unavoidable precondition for the
    implementation of the Balfour Declaration. And on the matter of
    imperialist motivation, we have an impressive roll call: Samuel,
    Kitchener, Lloyd George, Curzon, Bonar Law, Milner, Smuts, Churchill
    and the War Office in government; and Amery, Sykes, Kerr and
    Sidebotham on its influential margins. Some of the remarks may have
    been casual, tendentious or exaggerated, but the various individuals
    did all speak or write in unambiguous terms on the critical
    importance of imperial and strategic considerations, and all in
    remarkable (if possibly in part recycled) harmony" (243).

-   1922, it becomes clear that there would be no divorce between the
    marriage of Zionist prejudices and imperial, colonial, settler
    motivations.

-   Page 244. In 1922 Shuckburgh:

-   In may of 1923 Richard Meinertzhagen, a Zionist vet. Of the Egypt
    and Palestine campaigns, and a British delegate at the 1919 peace
    conference, was invited to advise the middle eastern dept. of the
    colonial office on clarifying and assisting the govt. strategic
    matters across the Levant.

-   When Stanley Badlwin took charge (new PM) he and his cabinet could
    not see a new power take control of Palestine as it would be
    embarrassing. The report was accepted on July 31, 1923

-   In October, Smuts had declared Palestine as an important location
    quote

-   The mandate allowed for the pursuit of pro-zionist policy. It would
    allow an imperial gain as a self-sustaining European settler
    community. Herbert Sidebotham was always eager to advance Zionist
    interest

-   The idea of an obliging Zionism performing long-term imperial
    functions for the British had been around for some time. At the turn
    of the century, the first great Zionist leader, Theodor Herzl, told
    Lord Lansdowne, then British foreign secretary, that any concession,
    anywhere, of colonizing land from the British would mean that
    \'\[a\]t one stroke England will get ten million secret but loyal
    subjects active in all walks of life \... all over the world\' ,
    \'ten million agents for her greatness and her influence\' . He told
    Lord (Nathan) Rothschild (father of the Declaration\' s recipient,
    Lionel Walter) that he could expect \'high credit\' from the
    government in London if he was able to help \'strengthen British
    influence in the Near East by a substantial colonization by our
    people at the strategic point where Egyptian and Indo-Persian
    interests converge\' (247)

-   The idea of long term imperial function for the british, through
    Zionism, had been around for a long time. Zionism was meant to act
    as a credit for british imperial prospects .

-   Alfred Milner was convinced of a Jewish state in 1914

-   Jan Smuts crucial test for Jews was that they should see their
    movement as naturally and organically linked to British imperial
    interest (248)

-   "Clearly, the direct equation of a Jewish national home with British
    strategic interests enjoyed wide currency in government circles in
    the 1910s and after, and Zionists in Britain were eager to feed such
    metropolitan fantasies." (248)

-   Chaim Weizmann believed that a Zionist Palestine would be a natural
    intermediary between Great Britain and Saudi Arabia

# (2) Balfour Declaration

-   France had taken Algeria and Tunis away from the Ottoman empire

-   Italy took Tripoli in 1912

-   Great Britain occupied Egypt from 1882 to 1914

-   Other countries would declare their independence as well

-   From 1800-1914 the Ottoman empire was being separated from its own
    empire -- Hadi sees two causes as to why Turkey was put into this
    position: one, it was under the absolute authority of the Sultan, as
    he was to maintain it; two, loyalty was dwindling away from several
    nations

-   Arab nationalism was growing prior to WWI, and several Arab leaders
    were organizing their own movements. In 1911 the Arab Congress
    convened in Paris with delegates from the Ottoman ruled
    Arabic-speaking countries as well as those from Europe and America.
    It was a review of the political situation in Turkey with special
    preference to Arab rights. One main objective was the ascendancy of
    the Arab political position in South Western Asia.

-   Turkish leaders tried to make amends
