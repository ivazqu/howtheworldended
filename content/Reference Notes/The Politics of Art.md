## Ch. 3 -- The Dissonance of Dissent

-   2010 Marwa Arsanios was given a pile of magazine from the Egyptian
    cultural magazine *Al-Hilal* from the 50s and 60s

-   Founded by Jurji Zaydan in 1892, well known Nahda-era wrtier and
    intellectual. The journal was Nasserist and Pan-Arab in its scope.
    The issues that Marwa received were advocating for secularism aimed
    at Islamic elements in society and a promotion of socialist ideals.

-   Industrialization, social housing, urban utopias, and Arab feminism
    where included.

-   Apart of Marwa's body of work was extensive research and theory on
    the regions modern history, and postcolonial experiments in the
    modernization of the 20^th^ century (through cultural memorabilia
    and public reading rituals)

-   Marwa along with other artist and scholars did a rereading of the
    magazine at 98weeks. It was an attempt at trying to grapple with one
    of biggest events/challenges of that year, the Arab revolutions of
    2011-2012, and the events that followed after.

-   The project emphasized a scrutinization of reading/writing,
    publishing, and their relationships in the regions modern history

-   The 67 generation felt disappointment in the vision of the
    postcolonial nation-state project as visualized in *Al-Hilal* and
    the loss of Palestine in the wake of Naksa. It countered their
    political and personal journeys of collective liberation from
    colonialism. This ran counter to what Marwa had anticipated, as she
    had hoped for a nuanced feminist reading of the past as a way to
    understand the contemporary moment.

-   She had hoped that it would reorient the past. The Arab uprising had
    put a stark reality on her project and the 67' generation: different
    methods of civil resistance, leadership roles, and aims of popular
    movements.

-   The 67' generation haunted contemporary debates on what it means to
    be counterhegemonic

-   It is haunting because they have become the measure

-   Kamal Boullata acknowledged that 70s Palestinian and Arab artist
    went through a fundamental change in how they perceived their
    artworks and societal roles.

-   "Galleries have become bodies with a soul"

-   "If art is the indispensable means of 'merging of the individual
    with the whole,' then art produced by Palestinians, especially after
    June 1967, is a first step toward this Union" (95).

-   60s artist are stuck? What is the revolution and place to which we
    refer to specifically? Is it specific to Palestine and anti-colonial
    struggle against Israel? Or is it a cause that is aimed at all power
    and the universal?

-   "the revolution" not starting from the same "place" takes the
    political action of explicit and confrontation resistance. The
    political and its relationship to politics reflect how institutions,
    actions, conflicts, and discourses define how resistance and dissent
    in the arts will look in any particular era.
