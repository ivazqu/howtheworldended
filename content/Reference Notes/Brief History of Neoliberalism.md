# Brief History of Neoliberalism

## Introduction

-       A theory of political economic practices that proposes that human well-being can best advanced by liberating individual entrepreneurial freedoms and skills within an institutional framework characterized by strong private property rights, free markets, and free trade.

-       The state is to create and preserve institutional framework by abiding to these traits

-       Must guarantee the quality and integrity of money

-       By setting up military, defense, police, and legal structures and functions required to secure private property rights and to guarantee by force the functioning of markets

-       If they don’t exist, they must be created

-       The emphatic turn can be traced in the 70s (although its history stretches far back)

-       It emphasizes the contractual relationships within the market place

		- Social good will be maximized by maximizing the reach and frequency of market transactions; all human action into the domain of the market

		- Thus producing technologies of information creation and capacities to accumulate, store, transfer, analyze, and use massive databases to guide decisions in the global marketplace
		- The greater the geographical range (globalization) and the shorter the term of market contracts the better


## Chapter 1 - Freedom Just Another Word
- 9/11 was seen as an attack on the term freedom

	- This was a justification on the attack on Iraq

- In 2003 Paul Bremer, head of the Coalition Provisional Authority promulgated four orders

	- The privatization of public enterprises, full ownership rights by foreign firms of Iraqi businesses, full repatriation of foreign profits, opening Iraq’s banks to foreign control, national treatment for foreign companies and elimination of nearly all trade barriers ; applied to all areas of the economy, except Oil

	- Strikes were forbidden, the labour market was under strict control

- Assets were sold off, in violation of the Geneva Hague Conventions

	- Though illegal as imposed by an occupying power, they would become legal of confirmed by a sovereign govt.

- What was imposed was a state apparatus to profit off of capital accumulation both domestic and foreign

- It reflects the interest of private ownership

- The Chicago boys (see page 8)

Why Neoliberal Turn?

- Restructuring of state forms and international relations after WWII was designed to prevent the conditions that had threatened capitalist order in the 30s

-  It was to prevent the re-emergence of interstate geopolitical rivalries that led to war

- A new world order was created through the Bretton Woods Agreement

	- Free trades in goods was encouraged under a system of fixed exchange rates anchored by the U.S. dollar convertibility into gold

	- Fixed exchange rates were not compatible with free flows of capital that had to be controlled – BUT the U.S. had to allow the free flow of the dollar beyond its borders if the dollar was to function as the global currency

		- Existing under the U.S. military power

“What all of these various state forms had in common was an acceptance that the state should focus on full employment, economic growth, and the welfare of its citizens, and that state power should be freely deployed, alongside of or, if necessary, intervening in or even substituting for market processes to achieve these ends. Fiscal and monetary policies usually dubbed ‘Keynesian’ were widely deployed to dampen business cycles and to ensure reasonably full employment. A ‘class compromise’ between capital and labour was generally advocated as the key guarantor of domestic peace and tranquility. States actively intervened in industrial policy and moved to set standards for the social wage by constructing a variety of welfare systems (health care, education, and the like).” (10-11)

- This is referred to as embedded liberalism

-  High rates of economic growth occurred in the 50s and 60s

	- Depended on the U.S. being prepared to run deficits with the rest of the world and absorb excess within its own borders

		- This benefitted export markets (obvi. for Japan, parts of Latin America, and South-East Asia)

“In the advanced capitalist countries, redistributive politics (including some degree of political integration of working-class trade union power and support for collective bargaining), controls over the free mobility of capital (some degree of ﬁnancial repression through capital controls in particular), expanded public expenditures and welfare state-building, active state interventions in the economy, and some degree of planning of development went hand in hand with relatively high rates of growth.” (11)

- Business cycles was controlled through Keynesian fiscal and monetary policies.

- Social and moral economies (a strong sense of identity) was encouraged through an interventionist state

	- “The state in effect became a force field that internalized class relations” (ibid)

-  60s, embedded liberalism breaks down, inflation rising everywhere, a phase of stagflation that lasted into the 70s

- Before the October 73’ and the OAPEC oil embargo, the Bretton Woods system of fixed exchanged rates by gold reserves had become chaotic

- The openness of state boundaries with respect to capital flows had stressed the fixed exchange rate systems.

	- The U.S. dollar had spread across the globe and where being deposited into European banks

- Fixed exchange rates were abandoned in 71

- Gold was no longer the metallic base of international system

- Advanced capitalist countries were exhausted by their embedded liberalism that had procured high growth rates. A call to answer was needed

	- More state control and regulation of the economy through corporate strategies. This meant sidelining the labour and popular movements through austerity measures, income policies, and wage/price controls.

	-  In the U.S. regulatory reform was legislated by the congress, signed by Nixon; governing everything: environmental protection, occupational safety, civil rights, and consumer protection

		- This effect polarized those behind social democracy and central planning and those with interest in corporate and business power and re-establishing market freedoms. The latter won.

- Capital accumulation effected everyone in the 70s

	- Discontent was widespread, labour movements were spreading and communist/socialist parties were becoming popular. There was a political threat to the economic elites and ruling classes everywhere

- Economic power shares were much larger post WWII, thus when growth began to collapse and interest rates were negative, paltry dividends, and profits were the norm, the upper class felt threatened

“Gérard Duménil and Dominique Lévy, after careful reconstruction of the data, have concluded that _neoliberalization was from the very beginning a project to achieve the restoration of class power._ After the implementation of neoliberal policies in the late 1970s, the share of national income of the top 1 per cent of income earners in the US soared, to reach 15 per cent (very close to its pre-Second World War share) by the end of the century. The top 0.1 per cent of income earners in the US increased their share of the national income from 2 per cent in 1978 to over 6 per cent by 1999, while the ratio of the median compensation of workers to the salaries of CEOs increased from just over 30 to 1 in 1970 to nearly 500 to 1 by 2000 (Figures 1.3 and 1.4).” (16)

“We can, therefore, interpret neoliberalization either as a _utopian_ project to realize a theoretical design for the reorganization of international capitalism or as a _political_ project to re-establish the conditions for capital accumulation and to restore the power of economic elites.” (19)

- See page 19.

- “The turn to neoliberalism thus depended not only on adopting monetarism but on the unfolding of government policies in many other arenas.” (24)

- The 73’ oil embargo placed vast amounts of financial power to the oil producing states. Saudi, Kuwait, and Abu Dhabi. The U.S. was prepared to invade these countries during that era in order to lower the price of oil.

- The Saudi’s agreed to recycle all of their petrodollars through the NY investment banks

	- The massive funds needed to find profitable outlets

		- i.e. poorer countries ready to borrow

		- NY investment companies looked at U.S. imperial strategies in order to look for investment opportunities in order to protect their foreign operations

- U.S. imperial tradition was in the making for a LONG time, in the 20th century it evolved into imperialism without colonies (?)

	- 20s is an example. Nicaragua and the U.S. investment both financially and through the military (See page 27). The return for the U.S. was open operations of capital and support in order to promote U.S. interest

- This was deployed after WWII during the era of decolonization (imposed by the U.S. onto the European powers)

	- Ex: the Iranian coup in 53’. Overthrowing the Mosaddeq govt. and installing the Shah of Iran (who gave oil contracts to the U.S.). The shah became a key oil guardian in the region

“In the post-war period, much of the non-communist world was opened up to US domination by tactics of this sort. This became the method of choice to ﬁght oﬀ the threat of communist insurgencies and revolution, entailing an anti-democratic (and even more emphatically anti-populist and anti-socialist/communist) strategy on the part of the US that put the US more and more in alliance with repressive military dictatorships and authoritarian regimes (most spectacularly, of course, throughout Latin America).” (28)

- See John Perkin’s _Confessions of an Economic Hit Man_

- Before 73’ much of the U.S. investments was in direct materials (oil, minerals, etc.) or specific markets (telecommunications, automobiles, etc.) in Latin American or Europe.

- “This required the liberalization of international credit and financial markets” actively being promoted in the 70s by the U.S.

- Poorer countries were encouraged to borrow at rates only in benefit of NY bankers

- By the mid 80s the IMF and World Banking system became an enforcer of free market ideologies and neoliberal orthodoxy (see Mexico’s default in 82-84 in which the U.S. rolled over the debt throught the IMF and U.S. treasury, but in return a neoliberal reform was needed in Mexico)

“In return for debt rescheduling, indebted countries were required to implement institutional reforms, such as cuts in welfare expenditures, more ﬂexible labour market laws, and privatization. Thus was ‘structural adjustment’ invented.” (29)

“Key diﬀerence between liberal and neoliberal practice: under the former, lenders take the losses that arise from bad investment decisions, while under the latter the borrowers are forced by state and inter- national powers to take on board the cost of debt repayment no matter what the consequences for the livelihood and well-being of the local population. If this required the surrender of assets to foreign companies at ﬁre-sale prices, then so be it. This, it turns out, is not consistent with neoliberal theory.” (29)

- The restoration of the elite ruling classes had to draw on surpluses extracted from all over the globe through international flows and structural adjustment practices

What is a general theory of class configuration in the Neoliberal order?

- the privilege of ownership and management of capitalist enterprises to pay CEOs in stock options

- the reduction of a gap between money capital earning dividends and interest, and on the other side, production, manufacturing, and merchant capital looking for profits

	- during the 70s much of the conflict between the two sides disappeared (see page 32)

“A wave of innovations occurred in ﬁnancial services to produce not only far more sophisticated global interconnections but also new kinds of ﬁnancial markets based on securitization, derivatives, and all manner of futures trading. Neoliberalization has meant, in short, the ﬁnancialization of everything.” (33)

	- This introduced more volatility into global exchange relations

	- Finance became a key concern over production

		- This became a key concern for the richest countries (the G7 group)

- Another notion of class would be the entrepreneurial opportunities opened up by new trading structures (Walmart, Microsoft, etc.)

- The international/transnational connections/establishments were always important throughout all these forms of class configurations; their dependence is to be acknowledge in the colonial and neocolonial era (see 35)

- See page 36-38 for a constructed idea of the term freedom within the neoliberal order


## Chapter 2 - The Construction of Consent
- Neoliberalization had to be accomplished through political consent (democratic means)

	- Common sense (sense in the common) grounds consent

	- “Common sense is constructed out of long-standing practices of cultural socialization often rooted deep in regional or national traditions. It is not the same as the ‘good sense’ that can be constructed out of critical engagement with the issues of the day. Common sense can, therefore, be profoundly misleading, obfuscating or disguising real problems under cultural prejudices.” (39)

	- Culture, tradition, and fears can be used to mask other realities

		- This was done through a number of devices: media, corporations, and institutions

“Appeals to traditions and cultural values bulked large in all of this. An open project around the restoration of economic power to a small elite would probably not gain much popular support. But a programmatic attempt to advance the cause of individual freedoms could appeal to a mass base and so disguise the drive to restore class power. Furthermore, once the state apparatus made the neoliberal turn it could use its powers of persuasion, co-optation, bribery, and threat to maintain the climate of consent necessary to perpetuate its power.” (40)

“Neoliberal rhetoric, with its foundational emphasis upon individual freedoms, has the power to split oﬀ libertarianism, identity politics, multi-culturalism, and eventually narcissistic consumerism from the social forces ranged in pursuit of social justice through the conquest of state power.” (41)

- Political movements that preach individual freedom are vulnerable to the neoliberal fold

- Individual freedom and social justice are not compatible

“Pursuit of social justice presupposes social solidarities and a willingness to submerge individual wants, needs, and desires in the cause of some more general struggle for, say, social equality or environmental justice.” (41)

- Neoliberalism did not create a separation between these two but it could exploit and instigate them

- Those seeking individual freedom (neoliberalist) and social justice saw a common cause (68’)

- Capitalist corporations , the market system, and businesses were also seen as an enemy

“By capturing ideals of individual freedom and turning them against the interventionist and regulatory practices of the state, capitalist class interests could hope to protect and even restore their position … Neoliberalization required both politically and economically the construction of a neoliberal market-based populist culture of diﬀerentiated consumerism and individual libertarianism.” (42)

- Pages that must be read starting from page 43 second paragraph to 48 “writ large” (but really to 54)

- See page 55 on how the Britain was different in its formation/marriage of neoliberal ideas into political/everyday life

- the commonality between the U.S. and U.K. lies in the fields of labour relations and the fight against inflation with respect to the latter

“Britain created what Marx called ‘an industrial reserve army’, he went on to observe, the eﬀect of which was to undermine the power of labour and permit capitalists to make easy proﬁts there-after.” (59)

- Opening up the market to foreign investors reduces the power of domestic labour movements

- The oil crisis can be seen as a testing ground for neoliberal order

- What Reagan and Thatcher did was turn minority political, ideological, and intellectual positions mainstream

“Clinton and Blair found themselves in a situation where their room for maneuver was so limited that they could not help but sustain the process of restoration of class power even against their own better instincts.” (62-63)
## Chapter 3 - The Neoliberal State
- Neoliberalization has evolved overtime, meaning that it departs from the template that the theory provides. It is unstable and contradictory.

- In theory it favors individual private property rights, rule of law, and the institutions of freely functioning markets and free trade

- The legal framework is negotiated contractual obligations between juridical individuals in the marketplace. The importance of contracts and the individual right to freedom of action, expression, etc. has to be protected

- The state must use its means of violence to protect and reserve these rights

- By extension, corporates are regarded as individuals

- “Private enterprise and entrepreneurial initiative are seen as the keys to innovative and wealth creation” (64)

- “Intellectual property rights are protected so as to encourage technological changes” (64)

- Increase in productivity equals “higher standards of living”

- Neoliberalism would end poverty through free markets

- Privatization of assets in crucial – if not it is an institutional barrier

- Public must turn into private

- Competition – between individuals to firms or entities – is a virtue.

- If the competition does not have rules or laws , the state must impose them (such as environmental rights or trading)

“Privatization and deregulation combined with competition, it is claimed, eliminate bureaucratic red tape, increase eﬃciency and productivity, improve quality, and reduce costs, both directly to the consumer through cheaper commodities and services and indirectly through reduction of the tax burden. The neoliberal state should persistently seek out internal reorganizations and new institutional arrangements that improve its competitive position as an entity vis-à-vis other states in the global market.” (65)

- Individuals are responsible for their own well-being

- The free mobility of capital between sectors to regions is crucial

_Must read pages 64 through 66_

Tensions:

- How monopoly power should be interpreted

- Market failure
	- When individuals fails to pay the full cost attributed to them by “shedding their liabilities out the market”
		- Pollution for example, chemical waste

“Asymmetric power relations tend, therefore, to increase rather than diminish over time unless the state steps in to counteract them. The neoliberal presumption of perfect information and a level playing ﬁeld for competition appears as either innocently utopian or a deliberate obfuscation of processes that will lead to the concentration of wealth and, therefore, the restoration of class power” (68)

- Alienating possessive individualism and collective life

	- While individual right is granted they cannot choose collective rights

	- An intense relationship between the state intervening by elites and “experts” of the world where there should not be any intervention to begin with

“Faced with social movements that seek collective interventions, therefore, the neoliberal state is itself forced to intervene, sometimes repressively, thus denying the very freedoms it is supposed to uphold. In this situation, however, it can marshal one secret weapon: international competition and globalization can be used to discipline movements opposed to the neoliberal agenda within individual states. If that fails, then the state must resort to persuasion, propaganda or, when necessary, raw force and police power to suppress opposition to neoliberalism.” (69-70)

_The Neoliberal State_

- It is difficult to create a template of the neoliberal state as divergences became apparent. As neoliberalization adapts and changes it becomes apparent that is uneven across time

- Two arenas that change neoliberal theory in practice

	- One, the need to create good business or investment climate for capital endeavors. If a climate disaster were to occur , the neoliberal state would protect the business climate over the natural climate

	- Two, they favor the integrity of the financial system over well being

	- An example, interventions by the state are done in favor of particular business interest, and credits “credits are arbitrarily extended from one state to another in order to gain political access and influence in geopolitically sensitive regions (such as the middle east).” (71)

- It is reasonable to attribute different state forms in the transition of neoliberalization – some states are still dealing with ramifications from their transition

- Development states become consistent with neoliberalization that they end up facilitating competition between firms, corps., territorial states, and accepting free rules of trade and relying on export markets – they become interventionist by maintaining good business climate

- Poorer states bail out the richer countries

- Theory and the practice of neoliberalization diverge consistently and drastically

“The extraction of tribute via ﬁnancial mechanisms is an old imperial practice. It has proven very helpful to the restoration of class power, particularly in the world’s main ﬁnancial centres, and it does not always need a structural adjustment crisis to work. When entrepreneurs in developing countries borrow money from abroad, for example, the requirement that their own state should have suﬃcient foreign exchange reserves to cover their borrowings translates into the state having to invest in, say, US Treasury bonds. The diﬀerence between the interest rate on the money borrowed (for example 12 per cent) and the money deposited as collateral in US Treasuries in Washington (for example 4 per cent) yields a strong net ﬁnancial ﬂow to the imperial centre at the expense of the developing country.” (74)

- The protection of financial interest and as they usurp surpluses is reflective the consolidation of class power

- There are limits to taking surpluses from poorer countries

- The issue with the neoliberals states approach to labour markets:

	- Hostility towards all forms of social solidarity, this in turns puts restraints on capital accumulation (trade unions must be abolished or controlled)

		- Flexible specialization vs.  Flexible accumulation

		- F.S can be used to create more flexible means of accumulation

		- The general outcome of the two is lower wages, increased job insecurity, loss of benefits/protection

	- Labour control and maintenance of a high rate of labour exploitation are central to neoliberalization

“It is precisely in such a context of diminished personal resources derived from the job market that the neoliberal determination to transfer all responsibility for well-being back to the individual has doubly deleterious eﬀects. As the state withdraws from welfare provision and diminishes its role in arenas such as health care, public education, and social services, which were once so fundamental to embedded liberalism, it leaves larger and larger segments of the population exposed to impoverishment.” (76)

- Social safety is reduced in favor of a system that emphasizes personal responsibility

- Behind this are shifts in governance:

	- More collaboration between public vs. private

		- Business and corporations collaborate with state actors: writing legislations, public policies, and setting regulatory frameworks

“The shift from government (state power on its own) to governance (a broader conﬁguration of state and key elements in civil society) has there-fore been marked under neoliberalism.11 In this respect the practices of the neoliberal and developmental state broadly converge.” (77)

- Legislation and regulatory frameworks produces an advantage for corp.; state assumes most of the damage while the private business takes the profit

- The state resorts to coercive tactics to repress forms of collectivity in order to protect corporate power – surveillance and policing increase  
  

“Class bias in decision-making within the judiciary is, in any case, pervasive if not assured.12 It should not be surprising that the primary collective means of action under neoliberalism are then deﬁned and articulated through non-elected (and in many instances elite-led) advocacy groups for various kinds of rights. In some instances, such as consumer protections, civil rights, or the rights of handicapped persons, substantive gains have been achieved by such means.”

- The period in which neoliberalization has become a dominant mode of influence is also the period in which civil society became central to oppositional politics (78)

- Neoliberalism is either a transitional form or unstable form, here are some contradictions that arise:

	- It is meant to take a back seat in and set the stage for the market, but it also meant to create a good climate for that market and be a competitive entity in global politics

		- In the latter it has to work as a collective corp. , but it gets in the way of market freedom

	- Authoritarianism competes with individual freedoms – this is highlighted in the lack of symmetry between corps. and individuals

	- It is crucial to maintain the financial system, but the operators within it produce volatility and instability

	- Monopolies

	- Moving more towards market freedoms and the commodification of everything produces social incoherence and the destruction of social forms and the idea of society itself. The reduction of freedom to corporate freedom produces the negative freedoms (criminality, pornography, virtual enslavement, etc.) that are then tied to positive freedoms

What might replace neoliberalism?

- Neoconservativism is concerned with order as the remedy to the chaos of individual interest, and over confidence in “morality as the necessary social glue to keep the body politic secure in the face of external and internal dangers”

	- In concern of order, it tries to strip the veil of authoritarianism that neoliberalism sought to envelope itself in

		- No society will inevitably lead to individualism ending social order

“The anarchy of the market, of competition, and of unbridled individualism (individual hopes, desires, anxieties, and fears; choices of lifestyle and of sexual habits and orientation; modes of self-expression and behaviours towards others) generates a situation that becomes increasingly ungovernable. It may even lead to a breakdown of all bonds of solidarity and a condition verging on social anarchy and nihilism.” (82)

- Thus neoconserv. believe in militarism as the antidote

- Although this is not new , the idea of ridding the country within and out of its enemies. Post Cold War the U.S. needed a new threat.

	- Radical Islam and China were the top candidates

		- Internal dissidents

			- All were combated with policing and stronger surveillance

- Neoconservative has always attempted to maintain and control the moral permissiveness that individualism promotes

	- Ideas and issues around morality, justice, and power have come into economics – what neoconserv. do is change the way those questions come into debate. In an attempt to counteract the individualism that neoliberalism promotes. They seek legitimacy of class power through the construction of consent and a coherent set of moral values. What moral value should prevail is the question.

	- The values that have become central are apart of a movement in the 70s that sought to maintain class power and business interest and an electoral base “the moral majority,” a white working class

- Although there is a heavy relationship between values, history, tradition, and nation, neoliberal theory does not favor the nation over the state

- Neoliberalism needs nationalism of a certain sort: an enforcer and competitor of the world market that seeks to create a good business climate; nationalism is what is mobilized in order for neoliberalism to succeed

“The invocation of moral values in the Iranian revolution and the subsequent turn to authoritarianism has not led to total abandonment of market-based practices there, even though the revolution was aimed at the decadence of unbridled market individualism.” (85)
## Chapter 4 - Uneven Geographical Developments
“The general progress of neoliberalization has therefore been increasingly impelled through mechanisms of uneven geographical developments.”

- The means by which class power could be restored was uneven but were gradual and were placed in the (around the 70s and more pertinently in the) 80s and concretized in the 90s. Four things were crucial in the development:

	- One, the turn towards more open financial markets in the 70s and its acceleration in the 90s. Foreign investment rose, unevenly, depending on how good the business climate was. Saudi and Israel being one of the top countries with foreign investments by the 2000s

	- Two, an increase geographically of capital. New countries for investment (countries that usurped neoliberal reforms, as the IMF and the World Bank sought good business climate)

	- Three, “the Wall Street–IMF–Treasury complex that came to dominate economic policy in the Clinton years was able to persuade, cajole, and (thanks to structural adjustment programmes administered by the IMF) coerce many developing countries to take the neoliberal road.” (92)

		- The U.S. was able to get high rates of return in the 90s from its financial and corp. operations in the rest of the world

	- Fourth, “the global diﬀusion of the new monetarist and neoliberal economic orthodoxy exerted an ever more powerful ideological inﬂuence.” (93)

		- Keynesian economics have left

		- WTO was the pinnacle of this

- Despite the ebbs and flows, analyses tell us that the power of neoliberal ideas, the need to respond to a financial crisis, and a “pragmatic” approach to reform the state apparatus in order to improve its global position in the market place are throughout the neoliberal agenda are apart of a class force
- Destruction of organized labour is a necessity for neoliberalism

## Chapter 6 - Neoliberalism on Trial
- The states that have powered the global the economy since 2001 are the U.S. and China (written in 2007)

- Growth rates in 1973 was the highest since 2003 . GDP 4.5

- Neoliberalization has failed to stimulate global growth

- Latin America experienced stagnation in the 80s. Argentina experienced total collapse

- Why then has neoliberalization been the only alternative?

	- The volatility of uneven geographical development has allowed for certain territories to advance

	- The process of neoliberalization has been successful for the ruling elite , rather than the theory

“Increased social inequality within a territory was construed as necessary to encourage the entrepreneurial risk and innovation that conferred competitive power and stimulated growth.”

- A burst in information tech.

- Its ability to redistribute rather than generate wealth by accumulation by dispossession

“These include the commodiﬁcation and privatization of land and the forceful expulsion of peasant populations (compare the cases, described above, of Mexico and of China, where 70 million peasants are thought to have been displaced in recent times); conversion of various forms of property rights (common, collective, state, etc.) into exclusive private property rights (most spectacularly represented by China); suppression of rights to the commons; com-modiﬁcation of labour power and the suppression of alternative (indigenous) forms of production and consumption; colonial, neocolonial, and imperial processes of appropriation of assets (including natural resources); monetization of exchange and taxation, particularly of land; the slave trade (which continues particularly in the sex industry); and usury, the national debt and, most devastating of all, the use of the credit system as a radical means of accumulation by dispossession” (159)

- Accumulation by Dispossession four main features:

	- One, privatization and commodification

		- Create new means of capital accumulation in fields that were regarded as off limits for profitability

- Public utilities, water, transportation, to social welfare provisions, and even warfare (private arm forces in Iraq)

- “The commodiﬁcation (through tourism) of cultural forms, histories, and intellectual creativity entails wholesale dispossessions (the music industry is notorious for the appropriation and exploitation of grassroots culture and creativity).” (160)

	- Two, Financialization. The movement of speculative and predatory economics. Deregulation opened the door for the financial system to become the locus of redistributive activity through speculation, predation, fraud, and thievery – it continues

	- Three, the management and manipulation of crisis. As an example, the redistribution of wealth from poorer countries into richer countries. The Mexico bailout in the 80s. Chile in the 70s. NY in the 70s.

		- “One of the prime functions of state interventions and of inter-national institutions is to control crises and devaluations in ways that permit accumulation by dispossession to occur with-out sparking a general collapse or popular revolt” (163)

	- Four, state redistributions. The state becomes a primary agent in redistributive policies. For example reversing the flow from upper to lower classes during the liberal era. This can occur through the privatization schemes and cutbacks of social wages.

		- Tax codes also redistribute wealth

_The Commodification of Everything_

- The assumption that the market and market signals can determine selective choices is to presume that everything can be a commodity

- The market can then be seen as a guide for human ethics and action. Neoliberalizaton has extended the reach of legal contracts.

- The heart of neoliberal theory is to construct markets for fictions, things that are not commodities (land, labour, and money)

- Individuals enter the labour market through a character(s) that is then taxonomized; from social relations to physicality, from skills “human capital” to taste “cultural capital.” Living beings that have inherited dreams, desires, ambitions, hopes, and fears.

	- For Capitalist, they are seen as production

- See 167 to 169 for Individuals in a Capitalist lens

- Neoliberalization strips away the protection that was implemented during the liberal era (early 20th century)

	- Trade unions and working class institutions are dismantled, particularly by the state

	- Withdrawal of social welfare provision, and technological shift/implementation into job structures which makes work redundant within the labour market

		- Enforcing short term contracts

	- Security of tenure becomes obsolete / archaic

	- Personal responsibility is implemented over social protections (which employers were once responsible of)

		- These must be bought instead

- Individual security is a matter of choice that is connected to the purchasing/affordability of financial/well-being products in a chaotic financial marketplace

- The second form that neoliberalization attacks is the spatial and temporal modes of life

	- Mobility is constrained. There is mass captive labour because of immigration laws. This is evaded through short contracts that allow “illegal” immigration to work within certain territories.

- Women bear the brunt end of all of this (see 170)

- Neoliberalization has repositioned women, labour, and indigenous groups into a commodity

- Stripped of social protection, the working population turn towards other institutional forms that construct social solidarity and collective will

	- Gangs to religious groups proliferate within this arena

“The rapid progress of evangelical proselytizing in the chaotic informal economies that have burgeoned under neoliberalization in Latin America, and the revived and in some instances newly constructed religious tribalism and fundamentalism that structure politics in much of Africa and the Middle East, testify to the need to construct meaningful mechanisms of social solidarity.” (171)

- Labour as a commodity leads to social dislocation, thus a rebuilding of social networks increase as a defense mechanism against the threat of its destruction

_Environmental Degradations_

- The views on the environment are uneven over time

- Thatcher took it seriously while Reagan did not, but there is still a negative trend that has been accelerating since the 1970s (and they soared in the 70s)

	- The accelerating destruction of rainforest since the 70s

- Short term contracts employ a labour workforce that works fast to extract supplies (especially while they last)

- Privatization makes it hard to create a global agreement on the principles and management of forest

	- Poorer countries are forced to open their forest to foreign companies under short contracts (imposed austerity)

		- Pressured to pay foreign debts

_On Rights_

- Neoliberalism has produced massive internal oppositional culture; although, opposition tends to accept many basic propositions of neoliberalism

	- It tends to focus on internal contradictions

	- It accepts the idea of the well-being of others and condemns neoliberal rhetoric, “But by focusing on those rights rather than on the creation or re-creation of substantive and open democratic governance structures, the opposition cultivates methods that cannot escape the neoliberal frame.” (176)

	- Advocacy groups and NGOs grew exponentially after the 70s

		- NGOs participate in social provisions (left by the state), allowing NGOs to become private, further allowing states to withdraw more social provisions. As private corps. they tend to be elitist and of benefit to their donors rather than the people they are meant to serve.

		- The often control their clientele

“But there is another reason why this particular oppositional culture has gained so much traction in recent years. Accumulation by dispossession entails a very diﬀerent set of practices from accumulation through the expansion of wage labour in industry and agriculture. The latter, which dominated processes of capital accumulation in the 1950s and 1960s, gave rise to an oppositional culture (such as that embedded in trade unions and working-class political parties) that produced embedded liberalism. Dispossession, on the other hand, is fragmented and particular––a privatization here, an environmental degradation there, a ﬁnancial crisis of indebtedness somewhere else. It is hard to oppose all of this speciﬁcity and particularity without appeal to universal principles. Dispossession entails the loss of rights. Hence the turn to a universalistic rhetoric of human rights, dignity, sustainable ecological practices, environmental rights, and the like, as the basis for a uniﬁed oppositional politics.” (178)

- The appeal to universalism makes it to easy for rights discourse to be embedded within the neoliberal frame – in spite of a progressive aim in mind

- Human rights are more problematic given the uneven political-economic circumstances around the globe

	- They also become easily adopted into imperialist dogma

		- Like the appeal of interventions in Afghanistan and Iraq

			- Justifying military humanism “freedom”

- The root of human rights based humanitarianism lie in the growing consensus support for the involvement in the internal affairs of developing countries since the 70s

- One should not merely allocate rights advocacy to neoliberalism – as there is a battle to be had

- See page 179-180 for the problematics of social justice

- Rights move around two logics of power: the territorial state and capital

- To live under neoliberalism is to live under the rights necessary for capital accumulation

## Chapter 7 - Freedoms Propspect 
- There is little room within the neoliberal structure that allows for an exploration of emancipatory explorations

	- Neoliberalization produces poverty, despair, hunger, etc.  If you do end up on the other end of the wealth scale, you find that there is little time to explore potentials outside of the marketplace – you live strung to the market and capital accumulation. Freedom shrinks within this context.

	- In this context oppositional cultures makes sense, signs for an alternative are everywhere

- Militarism abroad and domestically go hand and hand – the long planned international interventions by neoconservatives (after 9/11) had much to do with domestic control (195)

- U.S. hegemony has been wading since the 70s. It lost its dominance in global production then, and finance in the 90s

	- The result is two forms of nationalism: hyper inflation or deflation
