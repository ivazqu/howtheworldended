## Introduction
- August 2012, Canadian governor Mark Carney wanted to remove the female-Asian-image from the banknote and she was; she was replaced by a "caucasian looking women." This interaction of trying to put a proper ethnic representation on the bank notes is what this book focuses on; the interplay between asian racialization, settler colonialism, and capitalism, which is built out of the construction of the asian and jewish image.
- The erasure of the woman of color, and its replacement, serves as a form of national normativity and deviance, as a test of race, gender, and sex. The controversy of the bank notes pits the racialized other against the assumed stabilized form of capital. 
	- Day ask "How do we understand the variability of money as capitalist (rather than solely nationalist) fetish and its own racialized personas?" (page 3)
- The upward mobility of some asians in Northern America has given them the title of "new jews." It is an expression that represents an excluded community that has assimilated and has had a growth in wealth. This comes from a Pew 2012 research study which claimed that Asian-Americans were the highest and fast growing income earners, but what this study denies is the effect of affirmative action which asians are particularly effected by.  
- The Asian Canadian on the bank notes correlates race (asian subjects) to capital in abstract ways, even non-human, or disciplined and obedient. The economy of race is emphasized over human attributes; education adds a value to labor (as coined by Gary Becker in the 60s); the individual (race?) is seen as an enterprise driven by market values which assumed the "'infinite capacity for self-development."
	- Neoliberal theory promoted the idea of education and parenthood as the most critical investment with the highest rate of return.
		- Race as a market form which can be instrumentalized 
		- Race does merely flatten into human capital, but it is capital in of itself
- The bank note with signified an offensive form of "capitalism that (needed) to be neutralized" (p.6). It evokes a former personification of bad capital, one that is prior to the economic modalities that have re-shaped asian racialization.
- Iyko Day's text engages with settler colonial capitalism and its racial formation as a continued process -- which we are given the example from the racial formations/stereotypes attributed to Jews. 
- Settler colonial mythologies in capitalism are a system of representations that are objective (?) but immaterial, "immanent but subject to resignification" (p.7). Day use Marx's dialectical method which "emphasizes dynamic relations rather causation to illuminate the dualities and contradictions that emerge from capitalism" (ibid).
	- It is a key logic of romantic anticapitalism: "the misperception of the appearance of capitalist relations for their essence" - understanding the issue in representation as a posession of an attached (intrinsic) aesthetic dimension; for example, race through the human body becomes the form for which the abstract networks of capitalism manifest. 
- Asian personify a form of value formation through labor (in its abstraction, meaning the construction of value through education, family, and race ?)
- Abstract labor is a key concept within Cedric Robinson's "racial capitalism;" concrete labor is the representation of race, gender, and qualitative distinct form of actual labor which is then rendered abstract through value expression; the violence of capitalism is in how it abstracts by homogenizing a difference of gender and race in order to create value; the law of value obfuscates the racial and gendered aspects of labor power, as value is the metaphoric process for turning specific or particular labor into measurable units of abstract labor. 
	- all commodity-determined labor plays a role in social mediation which is structured by time; which, capital profits from (socially necessary labor time)
- social differentiation (is) a form of destructive abstraction anchored by a settler colonial ideology of romantic anticapitalism.
