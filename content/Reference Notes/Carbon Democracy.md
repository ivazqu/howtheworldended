## Chapter 1

-   It is often believed that where oil is produced, a lack of democracy
    exist

    -   In 2010 the 8 largest producers, Algeria, Iran, Iraq, Kuwait,
        Libya, Saudi, UAE, plus Qatar, produced 10.51 million bpd, while
        Libya produced 1.79 mill. bpd. Qatar had produced 1.43, had the
        largest production per capita and was the second largest
        producer of natural gas. Oman produced 869,000. Five countries
        that produced little oil have their internal conflict that is
        connect with Palestine: Israel/Palestine, Jordan, and Lebanon,
        and Morocco's phosphate industry.

-   Oil, the "curse," often discussed through money, not its production
    or distribution. A big reason as to why that occurs is because the
    surplus revenue gives govts. the resources and tools to "repress
    dissent, buy political support," relieve govts. of their pressures
    by "distributing prosperity, with public handouts and price
    subsidies." Oil is never discussed in terms of "the apparatus that
    turns this fuel into forms of affluence and power." It is discussed
    through a lens that only sees the govts. that profit or depend on
    it.

-   "An idea is something that is somehow the same in different places
    -- that can be repeated from one context to another, freeing itself
    from local histories, circumstances, and material arrangements,
    becoming abstract, a concept."
