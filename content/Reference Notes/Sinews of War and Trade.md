# Sinews of War and Trade

## Introduction

-   90% of the worlds goods travel by ship. Crude oil constitutes for
    30% of commodities carried on ship. 60% of the worlds trade in oil
    is by ship.

-   China is seen as the world's factory. The oil that fuels
    manufacturing in China comes from the Arabian peninsula. Much of the
    goods is then transported through the Arabian peninsula, Dubai's
    Jabal Ali.

-   In the 19^th^ century transport through the peninsula was an
    anchorage and command post for the British empire for its route to
    India.

-   Cities of Salt is a depiction of the transformation of the Arabian
    peninsula through oil and maritime infrastructure

-   New ports were created in order to find and dig up new petroleum,
    facilitate it

-   Between 1933 when oil was discovered in Bahrain and through the 60s,
    the coast line and cities were reshaped. Much of the new
    infrastructures for moving capital created distance between the
    ports and the people -- hidden behind fences, inaccessible, and
    securitized

-   Old forms of trade (pearls, fishing, dhow trades) were overrun by
    VLCCs, and ro/ro ships carrying cars and other manufactured goods.
    Harbors and warehouses shifted from city centers to more peripheral
    locations.

-   Maritime trade its logistics and hydrocarbon are clear purviews into
    how global capitalism operates today. Geoengineering of lived
    spaces; natural features into juridical features; the movement of
    commerce; fetishization; fictive commodities; speculation; and
    radicalized hierarchies of labour are formed through them

-   Multi-national law reinforces the economic environment and
    intercourse of maritime and hydrocarbon commerce

-   Chapter 1, focuses on how ports anchor sea routes -- have it be
    mapped on the sea or in route pricing indexes of maritime exchanges
    and freight markets. Harbours are not built off of objective or
    neutral calc. of cost. Politics and geopolitics matter as in
    Chapter 2. Environmental consequences are rarely considered. Chapter
    3, goes through the legal absent and present virtual scaffolding of
    maritime trade; the mapping and construction of ports are helped or
    dictated by arbitration courts which help capital move. Free ports
    are also important for the "macro-organism" of the economic
    environments of port systems. Chapter 4 deals with the construction
    of infrastructure within the land that is connected to ports.
    Chapters 5-7 are about the people who played major roles in
    constructing ports both the labour and the capitalist/govt. Chapter
    8 is about how war has help proffer ports.

## *Chapter 1, Route-making*

-   Malta has a free port which is positioned within range of the middle
    east, Africa, and europe, making it a good space to ship goods
    through

-   Technological change, invention of the steam ship, telegraphs,
    tankers, and internet cables, the rise of empires and their end, as
    well as the emergence of new nations, all contribute to shift,
    drawn, and redrawn routes across waters.

-   Before the advent of oil, pilgrimage was the largest factor in how
    routes were dictated

-   But now, travel is not the only factor. What cargo is being carried,
    the cost of transport, all determine how routes are shifted -- cargo
    ships then can be calculated as commodities as well

-   Before Europeans had forcefully entered the peninsula, Arabs had
    already maps and calculated how to navigate the seas

-   Goods in the Indian ocean were already being traded before the
    entrance of the Portuguese and the Dutch

-   Upon their forceful entrance, the coercion used to police ports was
    embodied across the infrastructure and logistics of ports. Conflict
    between the Dutch and the Portuguese reshaped how much cargo was
    being transported across seas. Spice became a huge commodity , and
    spice producing land became more profitable. The monopolization of
    certain commodities created new routes and diminished local and
    shorter routes along India and Southeast Asia

-   As Europe began to control trade through the peninsula and Indian
    ocean, especially through the British, ports became more
    specialized. This meant that only certain ships could travel to
    certain ports, which in turn meant that certain ports could be
    integrated into imperial networks. European powers took advantage of
    new legal systems and variations in sovereignty and arbitrage, as
    well as, new monetary and credit regimes.

-   Labour was hierarchized through institutional law, from wage labour,
    to forced labour and indentured labour. Sea routes, trade, and
    colonial bases were effected modes of production.

-   Steamships changed navigation as ships were no longer bound to
    seasons and winds

    -   They were first fueled by coal and then by oil

-   When the French had colonized Algeria in the 1830s, the British had
    feared that the Mediterranean was becoming French, like the Black
    Sea becoming Russian, so the British sought South Asia.

-   In the 1830s, the British East India Company began converting its
    fleet to steamships, signifying the rise of steam technology in
    maritime transport. However, it took several decades to fully
    convert all oceangoing ships traveling from the Cape of Good Hope to
    India. This transition prompted the Government of Bombay to seek a
    coaling station along the route from Bombay to Suez, leading to the
    occupation of Soqotra Island in the Indian Ocean in 1835.
    Unfortunately, Soqotra\'s harbors were inadequate for shelter, and
    the island lacked the necessary infrastructure for a coaling
    station. As a result, the British abandoned Soqotra and, in 1839,
    forcefully took control of Aden as an alternative strategic
    location.

-   Aden remained as a fueling port after petroleum surpassed coal.

-   In 1967, the British were driven out by anti-colonial struggles

-   In the 1840s, the British Admiralty began converting naval vessels
    to steam power, increasing the demand for imperial coal depots.

-   Between 1850 and 1869, British goods transported by steamships grew
    substantially from 168,474 to 948,367 net tonnage.

-   Steamship technology and imperial expansion were mutually
    reinforcing, as imperial steamships required frequent refueling,
    leading to the conquest of new colonial beachheads along trade
    routes.

-   These strategic outposts generated additional trade, administrative
    needs, capital investment, labor exploitation, and local knowledge.

-   The prevalence of British coal was due to its exportability from
    Wales and Northern England to colonies, encouraging
    industrialization at home and projecting power over overseas
    colonies.

-   British control of coastal areas in West, South, and East Africa
    ensured supremacy over the Cape route to India and dominance in
    steamer coal supplies from regions like Bengal, Borneo, and Natal.

-   The opening of the Suez Canal in 1869 made British imperial coaling
    stations and the connected routes even more crucial to Britain\'s
    maritime dominance.

-   British primacy over sea routes in the Red Sea, Persian Gulf, and
    the Cape was primarily attributed to coal resources.

-   While steam technology played a significant role, other factors also
    contributed to the mapping of routes and the importance of ports as
    landing stations during this period.

-   Before the telegraph, communication between empires was done through
    ships. Then the telegraph was invented and was crucial to the
    control of the colonies, between France and Algeria. The telegraph
    was crucial as it was able to gather intelligence from overseas and
    expand/project its power. It allowed for the British to consolidate
    their power in the regions they controlled during the 19^th^
    century.

-   The telegraph also transmitted world markets as it was able to
    transmit market prices. This influenced shipping times and routes.

-   The routes of telegraph cables then now closely mirror the pathways
    of fiberoptic cables.

-   "What is most striking about the maps that chart the routes of
    internet cables is the extent to which the density of cable internet
    corresponds to the weight and volume of shipping in a given
    geographic area." (27)

-   Internet cables are subsidized just as heavily as imperial mail
    ships were

-   European steam ship companies were chartering ships for pilgrimage ,
    the opening of the Suez only accelerated the trend of buying into
    the business. European shipping firms controlled shipping routes for
    pilgrimage until airplanes had taken over and better road
    infrastructure was implemented (until the 50s). 56' Suez Crisis
    accelerated the trend out of sea transport for pilgrimage as well as
    decolonial struggles in the 50s and 60s which European shipping
    companies left with their colonial state.

-   The construction of the Suez followed the cotton boom in Egypt in
    the early 1860s

-   "The opening of the canal encouraged the expansion of Aden and
    Jeddah, helped Britain consolidate its imperial power, facilitated
    the transformation of the petroleum industry (via opening markets in
    the East to Azeri oil), and accelerated the expansion of extractive
    industries in Asia and Africa." (31)

-   The canal allowed for Britain to consolidate its power in Asian
    countries. It also deflected trade from Egypt. The British also
    loaned Egypt money to construct the canal. When the payment was due
    the British used it as an excuse along with the Urabi revolt to
    occupy Egypt and secure its route through the peninsula. It was also
    other European powers that gained access and control as well.

-   The canal along with other new marvelous machinery helped to move
    capital and empire, but it also created cyclical loops of capital
    movement and reproduced empire. The canal was infrastructure for
    further colonial extraction of commodities and the expansion of a
    global economy. A vast majority of the expansion was investments in
    mineral in Africa and Asia.

-   The canal also helped foster the expansion of the oil economy
    through the transportation of oil through steam ships.

-   The Nobels of Sweden perfected the use of this.

    -   They had investments in Russian oil (Azerbaijan)

-   Marcus Samuel can be credited for this (founder of Shell)

    -   Iraqi-Jew

-   The British govt. had backed Samuel and the development of Murex
    (the first ship) as they felt they could gain an upper hand against
    the most dominant oil company then, Standard oil. They had feared
    that Standard would enter Asia. (yr. 1898)

-   Within a few years steamships became standard for the shipment of
    oil.

-   1910, 1% of tonnage traveling through the canal was oil, by 1960 it
    was 82%

-   The closure of the canal in 56' and 67' had impacted the
    transportation of oil so much that it inevitably led to VLCCs and
    ULCCs which traveled around the Cape of Good Hope.

-   After 73', the canal saw some of the oil transports coming through
    but mainly large amounts of construction materials into oil
    producing countries.

-   A new channel was canaled in the Suez in February of 2015 and
    completed by August of 2016

-   In 2017, when Saudi, UAE, and their allies declared a blockade
    against Qatar, the largest shipping company in the world, Maersk,
    announced that it was rerouting its containers intended for Qatar to
    Oman. Qatar eventually switched its hub to Oman. This was all too
    easily done as the transshipment network is an intertwined web.
    (Why? See page 38 and 40).

-   Freight rates played a role in how sea highways were formed, but
    from 1820 to 1913 freight rates plummeted by a factor of four as new
    technologies and modes of transportation changed and created more
    efficient methods (transport, building, etc). The British held a
    monopoly on freight rates , and they enjoyed cartel like movement
    more than fluctuating market prices: "British firms considered
    cartel arrangements more ethical than competition on price, which
    might deprive other \[British\] companies of their business. This
    form of business ethics derived from the idea that market
    competition was feasible only when a market was sufficiently
    developed. In this view, the Arabian Sea was too undeveloped an area
    to justify capitalist competition. "To build up business and develop
    local economies, profits had to be secured by the coercion and
    collaboration of firms. This ensured that British companies would
    receive 'handsome' profit margins on a smaller but more secure
    amount of business" (41).

-   Global shipping companies until 2008 had been comfortable in their
    cartel movement until Europe had gotten word that China and other
    Asian companies were threatening to pass reciprocal protectionist
    shipping regulations. This led to a drop in freight rates and it was
    in tandem with a 20% decline in global trade.

-   Pricing of goods is influenced by spot and forward contracts.

-   Spot transactions reflect the current price of a good at the time of
    purchase.

-   Forward commodity prices predict the future price of the desired
    good.

-   Forward contracts were created to reduce the impact of future price
    fluctuations by fixing exchange prices when the sales contract is
    made.

-   Forward contracts are commonly used for commodities with speculative
    pricing and production/export lead times.

-   Futures and options are derivative financial products from the 19th
    and late 20th centuries that speculate on spot and forward price
    differences. (See page 44 2^nd^ paragraph for an example on futures)

-   This same spot pricing and futures can be implemented into sea
    routes, such as the Baltic Dry Index, first implemented mid-18^th^
    century by the British and purchased by SGX in 2016.

-   Freight contracts were invented in 1985, and Freight options were
    invented in 2007 (at the height of sea trade)

-   Futures were meant to protect against volatility

-   Derivatives were originally designed for risk management in buying
    and selling to hedge against price fluctuations.

-   However, derivatives had two major consequences:

    -   They enabled speculation, making the underlying goods or
        products irrelevant to the exchange process.

    -   Speculation focused on price movements rather than the actual
        commodities being traded.

-   Financial derivatives fostered a significant gambling element,
    essentially allowing bets on stock market prices.

-   Derivatives could directly impact prices through a feedback loop, as
    mathematical models used for options pricing acted as engines, not
    mere reflections of reality.

-   These models provided an economic rationale for what might otherwise
    be seen as mathematically questionable practices.

-   Subjectivity is also at the heart of financial markets and price
    fluctuations. The traces of political relations lies inside of the
    electronic models that are dictating markets.

## *Chapter 2, Harbour-making*

-   Why were so many ports built in shallow seas? Most of the dhow ports
    now only exist as artifacts or for show in countries like Kuwait and
    the UAE. Dredging is one answer. Although politics and capital play
    a role in why some were built and why others killed off.

-   Dammam and Dubai were created to serve the needs of Aramco. In the
    1950s the construction in Dubai in the Dubai Creek led to the
    construction of Port Rashid and Jabal Ali.

-   Natural features are not a guarantee for a port. Geopolitics and
    politics is what influenced the creation and destruction of harbors.
    The creation of harbors changes the landscape of the shoreline as
    well as the areas where the materials are being extracted from.

-   History of Aramco and Saudi, pages 53-56

-   In the 50s Aramco's maritime operations required an outpost at
    Jeddah so that crude and fuel could be sold. The expansion of
    Dammam, Ras Tanura, and Jeddah come from a major program in 67' to
    deepen the harbors so as to accommodate VLCCs and ULCCs. In 74'
    Ju'ayma was built and till this day it is Saudi's largest
    crude-loading port. The 70s was nothing but expansion of tank farms,
    new berths, and offshore tech., including sea islands to load crude
    onto ULCCs.

-   This was to expand Aramco's dealings in Europe and the U.S. Only the
    Iran-Iraq war halted these ports for a while.

-   The dev. were done in cooperation with oil companies who did not
    specialize in harbor making. As in Kuwait as well as Bahrain.

-   This is a pattern all too familiar with corporate sovereigns of the
    colonial era (reminder of the British East India Company). Blurring
    the lines between the state and the company.

-   Dubai was formed in the early 70s.

-   Dubai had designated free ports which is what made their ports
    appealing, as well as its ties to India and Iran through trade and
    smuggling, and their connection to the British. Since 1904.

-   In the 1950s, British colonial officials were concerned about the
    impact of anticolonial movements and nationalist sentiments on their
    empire.

-   They recognized the Gulf region as a vital hub for oil production in
    the Eastern Hemisphere.

-   The British sought to promote economic development in the region as
    a way to prevent potential revolutions.

-   Local rulers also wanted to enhance their wealth and influence over
    the growing merchant class.

-   British political officers commissioned the engineering firm Halcrow
    to study the suitability of Sharjah and Dubai Creeks for a new
    harbor. Halcrow produced two reports, one for each emirate, which
    discussed the economic importance of the harbors and considered
    marine conditions for their design.

-   Dubai\'s commerce was described as "entrepôt trade in European and
    Far Eastern commodities" imported by oceangoing vessels and
    distributed by local craft. Sharjah was described as unprofitable.

-   Dubai was given the funds to further build out the port, Sharjah was
    left to dwindle out. See pages 57-61.

-   The dredging of Dubai's harbor led to the development of their
    smaller man-made islands. The waste of building harbors became
    profitable.

-   The closing of Sharjah's was in retaliation by the British as the
    saw their relationship with Nasser threatening. The emirates
    relocated their business to Dubai.

-   Port Rashid was planned during 67' and during its completion in 71'
    it had become congested with the independence from Aden

-   By the late 1970s, Port Rashid had become the largest port in the
    Gulf region. It was strategically located close to the city\'s
    commercial center. Port Rashid had the capacity to accommodate large
    container ships. Additionally, it featured a drydock suitable for
    repairing various types of vessels, including crude carriers,
    liquefied natural gas (LNG) vessels, and dredgers.

-   Shaikh Rashid appointed the British shipping firm Gray McKenzie to
    manage the port. This move extended the influence of the old and
    powerful colonial company into the commercial activities of the
    newly developed Dubai. The transformation of the old Creek harbor
    resulted in the creation of a dhow port.

-   The placement of Rashid was an act of "sovereignty" followed by his
    demand for Port Rashid to be built in 76'

-   Similarly, the dredged earth was used to build reclaimed land. (see
    how managed the port on page 64).

-   The 1960s and 1970s saw a surge in construction, town planning, and
    infrastructure development in the UAE, driving up the demand for
    materials like cement, sand, aggregate, and stone. The UAE did not
    have its own cement factory until 1975, so most cement was imported,
    primarily from Japan and other sources. Even the sand and stone
    needed for projects in Abu Dhabi and Dubai had to be sourced
    elsewhere.

-   Ghalilah and Khor Khwair in the northern emirate of Ras al-Khaimah
    became important sources for construction aggregate starting
    in 1963. In 1966, the first jetties were constructed in Ras
    al-Khaimah at the request of Abu Dhabi to facilitate the extraction
    of aggregate for the construction of Abu Dhabi\'s Port Zayed. Ras
    al-Khaimah\'s quarries were strategically located near the new jetty
    and had high-quality mountain rocks, rich in silicate and limestone,
    making them ideal for construction materials.

-   Extracting these valuable construction materials led to conflicts
    among local groups and disputes with the ruler over access rights
    and profits. Over time, major oceangoing ports were established in
    Abu Dhabi, Dubai, Sharjah, Fujairah, and Ras al-Khaimah, alongside
    numerous smaller harbors and oil terminals on and offshore.

-   Dubai\'s history and development share similarities with other
    port-states of the British Empire, despite being ridiculed for its
    rapid capitalization, mercantile background, and issues related to
    migrant workers and hierarchies of expertise and management.

-   Repeated colonial labour.

-   As one port rises another recedes. Old rort city where the port has
    ceased to exist functions differently from its initial inception
    (see page 68)

-   "Harbors are now less havens (as they were for the Dutch) than
    accelerated turning basins for supertankers and containerships. The
    old harbour front, its links to a common culture shattered by
    unemployment, is now reclaimed for a bourgeois reverie on the
    mercantilist past. Heavy metals accumulate in the silt ... The
    backwater becomes the frontwater. Everyone wants a glimpse of the
    sea" (69)

-   New cargo ports have replaced city-center ports and are
    characterized by their vast size, high security measures, and
    distance from the city center, making them challenging to access.

-   Old ports have been transformed into centers of entertainment,
    consumption, and tourism, mirroring the shift towards semi-automated
    cargo ports.

-   Key elements of modern free ports include the convergence of
    \"technology, trade, and tourism\" (Dubai\'s motto), the presence of
    far-flung ports, the use of \"accelerated turning basins,\"
    environmental impact assessments as an afterthought, and a strong
    emphasis on automation.

-   These modern free ports prioritize efficient commercial
    functionality and the technological marvel of colorful cargo
    containers, often obscuring issues related to ecological degradation
    and labor exploitation. Much of this history is influenced by
    colonial decision-making, underscoring the historical context and
    power dynamics that have shaped the development of these ports.

-   In 1837 East India Companies converted to steam in order to avoid
    the monsoon winds

-   Captain Stafford Bettesworth Haines played a central role in the
    story as he set out to survey the Arabian coasts. His journey
    brought him to the island of Soqotra, but the harsh harbor
    conditions and inhospitable climate led him to consider alternative
    options. Eventually, he determined that Aden would serve as a
    strategically valuable refueling port for steamships traveling to
    Suez and Alexandria.

-   The occupation of Aden in 1839 was not a mere coincidence but a
    calculated move by the British governorate of Bombay. The pretext
    for this occupation was an incident involving a stranded Bombay ship
    that was looted by locals. This incident, likely in collusion with
    the ship\'s owner for insurance takings, provided the necessary
    justification for British control over Aden.

-   Aden\'s ascent to global significance was primarily due to its role
    as one of the world\'s most crucial coaling stations. It bunkered
    more ships than nearly any other port, aside from major global hubs
    like London, Liverpool, and New York City.

-   To safeguard Aden from potential threats posed by Yemeni tribes, the
    British established a protective buffer zone around the port city.
    This zone was primarily manned by \"British troops, mostly Indian,\"
    ensuring the security of the strategic outpost.

-   As a bustling port city, Aden thrived as a multicultural hub where
    lighterers, fishermen (including Somalis), and traders from various
    corners of the world contributed to its vibrant economy.

-   The decline of Aden began with the closure of the Suez Canal in 1956
    during the Suez Crisis and once again in 1967 due to conflicts in
    the region. These closures had a profound impact, intensifying
    anticolonial struggles and ultimately leading to the British
    withdrawal from Aden by the end of 1967.

-   The establishment of the People\'s Democratic Republic of Yemen
    (PDRY) after the British departure resulted in a devastating
    economic collapse in Aden. A significant portion of the workforce
    migrated to the Gulf and East Africa, unemployment surged, and the
    port economy crumbled.

-   Although Aden experienced some recovery after the reopening of the
    Suez Canal in 1975, it was overshadowed by the burgeoning Gulf ports
    in terms of size and significance.

-   In 2008, Yemen entered into a significant contract with Dubai Ports
    World, entailing a substantial investment of \$220 million to
    enhance Aden\'s port capacity and infrastructure. However, by 2012,
    it became apparent that the promised improvements had not
    materialized as expected.

-   The United Arab Emirates\' return to Yemeni ports in 2015, as part
    of a coalition led by Saudi Arabia and the UAE, led to a complete
    halt in commercial activity in Aden and Hodeidah. The prolonged
    naval blockade and destruction of ports resulted in humanitarian
    crises, including famine and a cholera epidemic.

-   Notably, the CEO of DP World offered to restore the port after its
    destruction, underlining the complex dynamics where development
    projects can be presented as a form of coercive conquest.

-   Aden\'s decline underscores the intricate interplay between
    colonialism, the influence of regional capital, and geopolitical
    shifts in shaping the destiny of trade hubs on the global stage.

-   Ports provide a window into global commerce, offering glimpses of
    the hidden dynamics of capitalist accumulation, where money and
    commodities circulate to fuel the production and consumption of
    goods.

-   Walter Benjamin, in 1925, found cargo ports to be a sensory
    extravaganza. During a visit to Genoa on a freighter, he described
    the cacophony of unloading freighters as the \"music of the world,\"
    reflecting the cosmopolitan nature of these bustling hubs.

-   However, the audience for this maritime music has dwindled over the
    years, especially in ports located far from city centers. In the
    Arabian Peninsula, city-center harbors have transformed into spaces
    for hotels, cafes, or transit points for cruise ships, which serve
    as floating cities carrying both passengers and pollution.

-   The Arabian Peninsula\'s modern ports, especially those along the
    Persian Gulf, are characterized by the dominance of petroleum and
    chemical tankers, offshore platforms, and the crucial role of
    bunkering in the region\'s economies, particularly the UAE.

-   The Strait of Hormuz, the Malacca Strait, and the Bab al Mandab
    collectively handle a significant portion of the world\'s crude oil
    and petroleum products. Many tankers load their cargo at buoys,
    loading islands, and VLCC and ULCC terminals along the Peninsula\'s
    shores.

-   The massive trade in petrochemicals and crude oil is not without its
    environmental challenges. Oil spills, resulting from accidents
    during loading, unloading, ship groundings, or collisions,
    contribute to marine pollution. Coastal areas around the Gulf and
    the Arabian Sea bear witness to oil leakages and spillages, leaving
    lumps of tar buried in the sand.

-   Maritime pollution isn\'t solely attributed to tankers; container
    and bulk ships, discharging ballast water in unregulated or lightly
    regulated ports, release pollutants. Invasive species carried in
    ballast water from other seas further disrupt ecosystems.

-   Pollution also arises from activities related to bunkering ports,
    including the loading of lubricating oils and the disposal of
    sludge, a waste product from fuel purification. Surprisingly, there
    is a significant trade in tanker sludge, with financial incentives
    depending on the extractable oil content in the waste.

-   The construction of ports involves extensive engineering efforts,
    including dredging to deepen channels, land reclamation, and the
    construction of landside infrastructure. These endeavors presuppose
    the malleability of the earth and sea.

-   Ports\' expansion often leads them to relocate away from city
    centers, making them less accessible to the general public. This
    shift shapes not only the physical landscape but also labor
    practices, living conditions, and accessibility for port workers.

-   Deepening approach channels in shallow waters presents a unique
    challenge. For example, the approach channel to the container
    terminals at Jabal Ali has been carved out of a shallow seabed,
    requiring precise navigation by ships to avoid groundings.

-   The Gulf and Red Sea have distinct geographical features that
    necessitate innovative marine engineering. In the Red Sea, coral
    reefs pose challenges, while the Gulf features muddy shallows and
    shoals that require constant dredging.

-   The reshaping of coastlines through land reclamation, seabed
    lifting, and hill leveling has resulted in the loss of natural
    habitats and geographies, transforming the landscapes that were once
    familiar to fishermen, pearl-divers, sailors, and merchants in
    earlier centuries.

-   Engineering projects like land reclamation and dredging have not
    only altered the physical landscape but have also influenced
    governance, social relations, and economic systems, leaving enduring
    impacts on global commerce and capitalism.

-   Land reclamation in Europe, such as in the Netherlands, played a
    pivotal role in capital accumulation during the era of overseas
    colonization and the transatlantic slave trade, affecting not only
    local governance but also having far-reaching consequences on a
    global scale.

-   Certainly, here\'s a more detailed breakdown of the key points from
    the provided text:

-   The Dutch have a rich history of reclaiming land from the sea,
    utilizing their expertise in dredging technology.

-   This expertise extends beyond their borders, and Dutch firms like
    Van Oord and Royal Boskalis have played pivotal roles in
    transforming coastlines, particularly in port construction, on the
    Arabian Peninsula.

-   Belgian companies, including Jan de Nul Group and DEME Group, have
    also been significant contributors to these coastal transformations.

-   Over time, international competition in this industry has
    intensified, with Chinese, Korean, Malaysian, and established
    US-based dredging firms entering the market.

-   Notably, the National Marine Dredging Company, headquartered in Abu
    Dhabi, has emerged as a major player. It originated as a division of
    the Abu Dhabi National Oil Company and remains largely
    government-owned. This company collaborates with international
    dredging firms on massive projects such as the Khalifa port and the
    new Suez Canal.

-   Dredging activities can have catastrophic ecological effects,
    primarily due to the disruption of seabed sediments and the
    disturbance of delicate underwater habitats.

-   The region is particularly vulnerable to these disruptions due to
    the frequency of oil spills, sedimentation from airborne pollution,
    and the presence of contaminants from past wars. Dredging
    exacerbates these issues by reintroducing toxic residues into the
    water.

-   Coral communities are severely affected by the actions of dredging
    cutters and suction pipes.

-   Valuable ecosystems like sabkhas (salt flats) and mudflats, which
    support diverse marine and coastal species, often suffer degradation
    as a result of dredging.

-   The Gulf region\'s inherently unstable coastlines, which shift
    dramatically due to tidal surges and storms, further compound the
    ecological impact of dredging.

-   Dredging harms the spawning grounds of prawns and fish through both
    direct physical disturbance and secondary effects such as increased
    turbidity, siltation, and sedimentation.

-   Given the shallow nature of the Gulf, shorelines and wide approach
    channels to berths are frequently dredged.

-   As ships grow in size and draught, these dredging projects become
    cyclical, repeatedly disrupting seabeds that may have only recently
    recovered from previous dredging activities.

-   Land reclamation efforts often lead to the destruction of vital
    coastal ecosystems, including mangroves, shallow-water marine
    environments, and habitats essential for migratory and local bird
    species.

-   Filling coastal areas with material dredged from the sea introduces
    sedimented marine pollution into these liminal coastal regions and
    shorelines. Additionally, changes in shoreline morphology can
    paradoxically increase erosion.

-   Land reclamation has far-reaching legal and political consequences.
    As coastlines shift and the physical landscape changes, maritime
    borders, exclusive maritime economic zones, and other topographic
    features are redefined, leading to disputes.

-   Land reclamation can alter the definition of international waters
    and create value seemingly out of thin air. Major investors in land
    reclamation projects benefit disproportionately, both economically
    and politically.

-   The authority to create land from the sea is also seen as a form of
    accumulation by dispossession, where common resources, in this case,
    the sea, are enclosed for the purpose of speculation and profit.

-   In some instances, investigative reports have uncovered shell
    companies in places like Bahrain, allowing royal families to profit
    from land reclamation projects.

Land reclamation necessitates significant engineering efforts, involving
the movement of substantial quantities of soil, sand, stone, and
concrete.

-   Concrete production plays a crucial role in these projects. The
    composition of concrete, which includes cement, sand, and aggregate,
    varies depending on the specific environmental conditions and
    intended applications.

-   Sand is one of the world's biggest commodities, nearly 59b tons are
    mined every year. The world consumes nearly 40b tons of sand each
    year. Sand is becoming an ecological crisis as it shift the waters
    environment.

-   In the 50s and 60s, the making of harbors in Dubai and Abu Dhabi
    resulted in conflect over profits. Local residents wanted a share of
    the profits while the European companies exploited their resources,
    and the emirates ignored them. Today large amounts of sand come from
    areas outside of the peninsula. Similarly, to make concrete --
    limestone is required, and it has to be baked at high temperatures
    which require a ton of fuel. For every one ton of concrete made
    about one tone CO2 is released into the atmosphere.

-   Much of the cement was imported from outside countries. Now they all
    have cement factories.

-   *"When* things began to change matters as much as how. *Where*
    profit was repatriated matters in seeing who benefitted. Tracing the
    movement of materials, labour, expertise, and capital across the
    continents and oceans shows why these ports thrived, and in thriving
    remade the sea and the land around them, as well as the effect of
    their expansion and growth in faraway places." (85)

## *Chapter 3, Palimpsests of Law and Corp. Sovereigns*

-   Aristotle Onassis built his fortune by shrewdly anticipating
    transformations in the world of shipping. After World War II, he
    built a fleet of megatankers and whaling factory ships, and picked
    up several T2 tankers at a discount from a US government
    ship-decommissioning programme.

-   In 1953, Onassis negotiated with the Saudi government to give his
    tankers the exclusive right to transport Saudi petroleum. A shipping
    company, Saudi Arabian Tanker Company, was formed, and a maritime
    college was established.

-   Once the agreement was publicized, Aramco objected, and concerns
    were raised about the possibility that Onassis would ship oil to the
    Soviet bloc.

-   The Dulles brothers, Secretary of State and head of the CIA, worried
    that the deal signaled King Saud\'s unacceptable autonomy from the
    US and that he would nationalize Aramco. The Defense Department saw
    Onassis\'s encroachment on Aramco\'s shipping business as a threat
    to its access to inexpensive fuel.

-   The British had their own bones to pick with Onassis, who threatened
    the dominance of British Petroleum\'s tanker business and the slowly
    recovering British shipping industry. They also feared that
    Onassis\'s entry into Kuwait could endanger British interests beyond
    Saudi borders.

-   In July 1954, a National Security Council meeting under President
    Eisenhower issued a memo that specifically mentioned Onassis. The
    memo called for the US to take \'all appropriate measures\' to
    cancel the agreement.

-   The US\'s commercial and military interests intersected with the
    Saudi government\'s desire for arbitration. The Saudi government
    introduced a new requirement into the arbitration, and the US
    advised the Saudi government to take a firm line with Aramco.

-   In 1956, the case finally went to the arbitration tribunal in
    Switzerland, which decided that the concession agreement signed in
    1933 was the law of the land and that the state had no right to
    compel Aramco to sell its oil on the condition that it be
    transported on Saudi flag ships.

-   The tribunal ruled that Aramco had exclusive rights over the high
    seas and that Saudi Arabia\'s claim to jurisdiction over its own
    borders or maritime business was unjustified under international
    law.

-   Stephen Schwebel, who later became president of the International
    Court of Justice, celebrated the arbitral decision for addressing
    \'questions of lasting importance\' and revealing the irrevocable
    losses to public good and sovereign rights that emerged from this
    battle.

-   Law mattered to sovereignty, capital accumulation, and maritime
    businesses. Colonial legal regimes left their traces in much of
    maritime law.

-   International commercial arbitrations had long existed, but they
    expanded during the Industrial Revolution and the concurrent
    consolidation of imperial control overseas.

-   In Britain and the US, parliamentary acts regulated commercial
    arbitration and established the rules for tribunals. The postwar
    wave of decolonization only intensified this urge to develop complex
    legal apparatuses, doctrines, and rules to protect the alien
    property of North American and European investors and firms.

-   After nationalizing the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company, Iran insisted
    that any disputes with the Company would have to be settled in
    Iranian courts, but found himself facing the Company in the Hague.
    International arbitration protected the property of investors and
    guaranteed confidentiality and secrecy to corporate litigants.

-   Euro-American investors developed models for bilateral investment
    treaties, which were adopted by OECD countries. These complex
    treaties often stipulated international arbitration as a means of
    dispute resolution.

-   Aron Broches, general counsel of the World Bank, developed a series
    of procedures to protect foreign investors against postcolonial
    state demands. The World Bank arbitration forum came into force in
    1965.

-   The investor-state dispute forum\'s reliance on administrative
    procedure veiled the political stakes, and in the vast majority of
    instances, the forum decided for the corporations. However, not all
    corporations or all states are created equal.

-   DP World signed contracts for ports in the Indian Ocean basin,
    including Doraleh and Aden. The first two contracts were reportedly
    acquired through bribery.

-   In Aden, DP World\'s large cash payment to the beleaguered president
    of Yemen, Ali Abdullah Salih, bolstered Salih without redistributing
    any of the port\'s benefits to impoverished southern Yemen. Local
    political groups objected to the deal very early on.

-   Djibouti accused DP World of bribing the former chair of Djibouti
    ports, and cancelled the concession. DP World went to arbitration,
    and won both times, but Djibouti rejected both rulings and signed a
    contract with Chinese firms to develop a free zone at Doraleh.

-   In 2006, DP World acquired the ports management arm of the British
    P&O for £3.92 billion. However, a bipartisan group of
    Congresspersons opposed the deal and DP World was commanded by Abu
    Dhabi to sell its stakes in those six ports to AIG.

-   The US was far too powerful a patron to challenge DP World, and
    state power emanating from the North Atlantic still counts for
    something.

-   The most significant of the nineteenth century\'s exploited oceanic
    commodities were the products of whaling. The industrialization of
    fisheries by the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries led
    to contention between Euro-American businesses and the peoples of
    the tricontinents.

-   Offshore exploration for petroleum and other mineral resources began
    in the coastal waters of the United States and shortly thereafter in
    Venezuela. New technologies were invented and tested to drill for
    oil below the seabed.

-   The US federal government claimed dominion over offshore resources
    in September 1945, when it brought a court case against California
    to determine who had the sovereign right to explore \'vast
    quantities of oil and gas underneath\' the land beyond a three-mile
    offshore limit.

-   The Truman proclamation led to similar announcements overseas,
    including those by Saudi Arabia and Iran, and the British government
    advised the rulers of the states in the Persian Gulf to take similar
    action.

-   Within days, rulers of the emirates around the Gulf issued their own
    proclamations of jurisdiction over their seabed and continental
    shelf. These proclamations conform broadly in their terms to the
    Truman proclamation.

-   While British colonial officials legalized the contours of oil-rich
    Gulf seabeds, they did not have the same urgency for their colony at
    Aden, which was not known to be rich in mineral resources.

-   Qatar was involved in two arbitration cases that crucially depended
    on the definition of maritime limits and boundaries. Qatar won both
    cases.

-   In 1935, Shaikh Abdullah bin Jassim al-Thani granted an oil
    concession to the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company, which assigned its
    concession to Petroleum Development Qatar.

-   In 1949, the emir of Qatar claimed jurisdiction over the high seas,
    but two months later he signed an agreement with two oil companies
    to explore for oil in Qatar\'s waters. Petroleum Development Qatar
    saw this as a violation of their contract with the ruler, and
    brought an arbitration case against him.

-   A tribunal decided that Petroleum Development Qatar had the right to
    explore in Qatar\'s territorial waters, while International Marine
    had the right to explore further out.

-   International Marine refused to pay the ruler 1 million rupees after
    cancelling their concession, claiming that the payments were an
    advance payment and not an arrears one.

-   In the Petroleum Development Qatar case, the tribunal ruled for the
    Qatari ruler rather than the petroleum companies, and the more
    important case was about the competing interests of US and UK firms
    rather than the Qatari public good.

-   In the early 1950s, arbitration tribunals were held in European
    capitals over the right of exploration at sea. These tribunals ruled
    in favour of European and North American corporations staking claims
    to territories usually associated with sovereign states.

-   The British agent wrote to the representative of Petroleum
    Development (Trucial Coast) Ltd that it would be difficult to
    convince the rulers that the company was merely clarifying the
    present uncertain status of the sea-bed, and that they were not
    trying to hustle them through arbitration.

-   The maritime boundaries between states were decided by competing oil
    officials in the US or UK, rather than between the rulers of those
    states. British oil companies called for arbitration of disputes to
    take place in English forums.

-   The Arab rulers tried to offset the power of the British oil company
    by making deals with North American or other European companies, but
    the final decision was often settled in courts of arbitration.

-   The arbitrator, Lord Asquith of Bishopstone, prefaced his ruling
    with a condescending pronouncement from the haughty summits of
    colonial superiority, and even admitted that English law was
    \'inapplicable as such\'. However, Asquith ignored the enormous
    significance of legal practice, thinking, and relations in the
    region.

-   The avenues in which law worked were broad and variegated, and
    European imperial powers attempted to graft their own legal and
    political systems onto this complex legal topography.

-   Hugo Grotius\'s notion of freedom of the seas was crucial in
    establishing a series of dicta that have become central to maritime
    and commercial jurisprudence. His writings brought into view a legal
    argument to distinguish between the sovereign\'s public rights and
    private rights of ownership.

-   Grotius\'s notion of divisible sovereignty meant that indigenous
    sovereigns could delegate their privileges and prerogatives to their
    imperial protectors and patrons, and that the imperia could claim
    coastal areas, navigable rivers, and the ability and freedom to
    navigate by sea for themselves.

-   The global struggle over subsea resources is largely a result of the
    encounter between states in the global South and powerful corporate
    bodies engaged in capital accumulation. This struggle is largely a
    result of the colonial era\'s legal proclamations over subsea
    geophysical features.

-   The first United Nations Conference on the Law of the Sea took place
    in 1958. It defined the various sovereign claims to the sea,
    reinforced the openness of the high seas, and protected those who
    could lay or use submarine cables and pipelines.

-   In all conferences in which representatives from newly sovereign
    states met the former colonial powers, this inequality in claims and
    abilities was openly on display. The definitions of \'adjacent
    waters\' and \'areas beyond national jurisdiction\' were sources of
    contention.

-   The global South argued that the seabeds are the property of every
    human being and that any profit from their exploitation should be
    distributed to all states. However, the neutrality of the law
    allowed only the richer nations to exploit them.

-   The sea was more than a shoreline, shelf edge, base of continental
    slope, toe of continental rise, axes of trenches, deepest parts of
    abyssal plains, and the mid-ocean rift for major imperial powers.

-   The convention that finally emerged enshrined the principles of
    \'ownership\' and rules of property over common resources,
    transforming commonly held public goods into privately held
    property.

-   Free Zones are established by poor countries to show the world that
    they are serious about development. They are often enclosed with
    barbed wire and relatively absolved from environmental and labour
    regulations, critical scrutiny, and often accountability.

-   The British Empire designated a string of strategic bases and
    coaling stations from the Atlantic to the Pacific as free ports.
    These ports allowed the maintenance of long shipping routes and
    further projection of imperial power, and simultaneously captured
    trade from rival ports, enriching merchants and capitalists allied
    with the British.

-   In the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, Arabian Peninsula ports
    acted as informal free ports, and Dubai, which abolished customs and
    taxes on merchant trade, famously benefitted from the mass migration
    of merchants from the port of Lengeh in Iran.

-   The British protectors of the Gulf emirates encouraged free-port
    arrangements, particularly for their favored and more amenable
    allies. In 1958, they designated Manama in Bahrain a free port, just
    as construction of the modern Mina Salman began there.

-   Free trade zones were set up in New York in the 1930s and were
    exported overseas by US policy-makers, capitalists, their comprador
    allies, and management consultants. They were explicitly intended to
    shield against the larger appeal of socialist or anticolonial
    nationalizing ideologies.

-   In the early 1970s, the Ba\'ath Party established five free zones in
    Syria, and the Sadat regime opened up the economy and encouraged
    foreign investment.

-   Free zones are securitized islands surrounded by moats of highways
    and barbed-wire fences, in which states intentionally exercise a
    \'variegated sovereignty\'88. They are offshore spaces but onshore,
    where legal striations allow accumulation of capital without
    restraints.

-   Arab states were not strangers to free zones by the 1970s, but some
    city-states of the Peninsula were not eager to establish them.
    Kuwait, despite having a vocal capitalist class, did not inaugurate
    a free zone in the 1970s, despite merchants clamoring for one.

-   The first free zone in the Peninsula was at Aden, which was
    established in 1970 under a socialist government. It allowed
    divergent rules of taxation to apply in different locales.

-   One effect of free zones has been an emphasis on exports at the
    expense of local manufacturing. The World Bank made free zones a
    condition of structural-adjustment programmes for indebted countries
    of the global South, but whether they actually performed as promised
    is another story.

-   The Jabal Ali Free Zone was planned before engineering on the port
    began in 1976, though the decree for its operation was not issued
    until the mid-1980s. The federation of the seven emirates impinged
    on the city of Dubai\'s operation as a free port.

-   The ruler of Dubai founded a vast free zone close to the Abu Dhabi
    border, signaling intent to maintain a degree of commercial
    independence from their much more powerful neighbor. The free zone
    allowed foreign firms to operate in its territory and export to or
    import from Iran.

-   The UAE\'s ports and drydocks provided shelter to ships damaged in
    the Tanker Wars, and the US wars against Iraq and Afghanistan
    enriched the Jabal Ali Free Zone.

-   Jabal Ali Free Zone provided an escape route from European import
    quotas on textiles and invisible nontariff barriers to textile
    importation from South Asia. Its textile manufacturing sector became
    so large and successful that by 1989 the US was threatening to
    impose import quotas on UAE textiles.

-   Foreign businesses prefer operating in the free zone because of the
    political stability, access to telecommunications, transport and
    banking services, and the absence of taxes. The free zone also
    houses warehouses storing US military materiel and humanitarian
    organizations that increasingly use Dubai as their base of
    operations.

-   Saudi Arabia has no \'free zones\', although \'logistics cities\',
    \'economic cities\', and \'industrial cities\' proliferate there.
    The first of these were Jubail and Yanbu, which were designated
    \'industrial cities\' by a 1975 plan, and were also given a separate
    authority to govern them, the Royal Commission.

-   The Royal Commission deepened the harbors and improved the roads
    emanating from the industrial cities on the coast, and Yanbu was
    built as a Red Sea port because the Iran - Iraq War made Gulf ports
    and terminals more dangerous.

-   The British marine engineering firm Halcrow built the port at Jubail
    under contract with the Ministry of Communication, while Saudi
    Arabian Bechtel Company and Saudi Parsons were the primary
    contractors for other infrastructures in the two cities. Aramco was
    crucial to the functioning of the two industrial cities.

-   The new economic cities sought to take advantage of trade and cargo
    movement, and the King Abdullah Economic City at Rabigh is planned
    to have the second largest cargo port in the Kingdom, after Jeddah.

-   The economic cities were intended to be orientated towards services
    rather than upstream industries, but the first cargo exported from
    the King Abdullah Port was a consignment of polymers shipped to
    Singapore in 2014.

-   When Salman bin Abdulaziz became king of Saudi Arabia, his son
    Muhammad bin Salman was appointed deputy crown prince and eventually
    took his place. Muhammad bin Salman concentrated power in his own
    hands and built the Neom megacity with its own regulatory bodies and
    judiciary.

-   Neom is a planned port city in Saudi Arabia, straddling one of the
    world\'s most significant shipping lanes, and is close to Israel,
    now a de facto Saudi ally.

## *Chapter 4, Roads and Rails Leading Away*

-   The Alireza family\'s Ford and Lincoln showroom, repair shop, and
    office building is in striking contrast to the older buildings in
    Jeddah. It features Arabia\'s first neon sign and gleaming, new
    four-door sedans.

-   Walter Rodney describes how roads and railways in Africa were built
    to make business possible for timber companies, trading companies,
    and agricultural concession firms, and for white settlers. These
    roads and railways were woven together by a network of roads and
    rails leading away from the sea.

-   In the Arabian Peninsula, petroleum was also a significant factor in
    the development of hinterland infrastructures, but pilgrimage and
    trade were and continue to be important in road-planning.

-   During World War I, the Ottoman Empire\'s railway network was
    repeatedly sabotaged by T.E. Lawrence and his Arab allies. The
    Ottoman forces regularly repaired the line and used it for military
    transport, but at the end of the war, the Hijaz Railway was no
    longer functional.

-   The Saint-Simonians pioneered railway construction in the Mashriq,
    and the British and French struggled to maintain competing routes on
    land and sea. The French managed to buy into the Berlin - Baghdad
    financing, and forged the infrastructural power required for
    claiming the mandate there after World War I. Ground transport was
    fundamental to military logistics and was reserved for military and
    materiel during World War II. The entire infrastructure of ground
    transport created new economies and social relations, new forms of
    rule and military control. Roads differed from railways in
    significant ways, including the fact that they could be built more
    easily in times of economic contraction.

-   Before oil was discovered in commercial quantities, the Arabian
    Peninsula\'s best roads were those serving the pilgrimage in the
    Hijaz and others connecting coastal towns and villages to major
    regional hubs. Early models of cars could handle sand-tires better
    than other models.

-   Early roads began as oiled-sand surfaces, and later roads cut
    through impossibly treacherous mountains and dune-cloaked deserts.
    They brought along the reach of the state, its laws and regulations,
    its security forces, and its economic plans, agendas, and
    ideologies.

-   Road-building was an engine of transformation in the Peninsula.
    Bahrain\'s small size and head-start account for the density of
    roads there, while the UAE only saw a concerted effort after the
    departure of Britain.

-   Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Yemen, Bahrain, Oman, UAE, Qatar, Bahrain, and
    Yemen have the longest paved roads in the Arabian Peninsula, while
    Saudi Arabia has the shortest paved roads in the Arabian Peninsula.

-   After four months of unrelenting labor, the shoreline and port in
    front of the American compound were completed, and several roads
    were opened.

-   Aramco needed ports and roads to transport heavy goods to the
    oilfields, and eventually refineries and TAPline stations, and to
    the compounds that housed Aramco employees.

-   Trucks arrived shortly before the coming of the paved highways to
    transport goods and people between the new ports and nearby cities.
    The trips between the two towns usually took about thirty hours
    because the truck always got a flat tire or broke down on the road.

-   King Abdulaziz ibn Saud\'s road-building projects were influenced by
    political ambitions, imperial greed, and global networks of
    expertise, capital and power.

-   The US Army Corps of Engineers and Aramco worked with the same
    contractors to build infrastructures in eastern Saudi Arabia that
    consolidated the strategic foothold of the US and Aramco over the
    extraction of Saudi Arabia\'s natural resources.

-   Ibn Saud demanded a railroad to connect Dammam to Riyadh, and the
    British political resident in Bahrain snidely commented that if they
    would not oblige him, he would apply elsewhere.

-   The Aramco-designed railroad connecting Dammam\'s cargo port to
    Riyadh opened in 1952. The rail traffic and port cargo mutually
    increased one another, but there was no certainty that the railroad
    would continue to be used beyond the early construction boom.

-   In 1952, James H. Gildea was tasked with extending the railway from
    Riyadh to Jeddah. But, because the public goods allocated to the
    Hijaz did not equal those given to the Najd, and because the
    economic center of the country had shifted, the railway was never
    built.

-   As the plans for the development of the railroad began, Aramco also
    started to produce roads built mostly of crushed rocks or of
    petroleum waste directly applied to sand. The roads provided a
    market for the company\'s own refined products.

-   In the colonial period in Africa, roads were not constructed to
    facilitate internal trade in African commodities, and all roads led
    down to the sea. In Saudi Arabia, the national road network began to
    expand only after 1975, when Aramco was nationalized and oil
    revenues began pouring into the Saudi treasury.

-   Saudi Arabia has not been the only place where oil roads transformed
    the shape of transportation. In Kuwait and Bahrain, the main road
    from Kuwait City center to the oil fields was paved by the Kuwait
    Oil Company, and a tanker pier near its refinery was built by BAPCO.

-   Roads as Economic Pacification Weapons: Dhofar\'s isolated position
    keeps out most visitors and greatly restricts imports and exports,
    Salalah harbor has little protection against the monsoon winds, and
    the overland journey from Muscat is impossible for motors and still
    takes twenty days by camel.

-   Henderson\'s oil exploration excursions were indistinguishable from
    military expeditions, and British officers of the Trucial Oman
    Scouts were happy to assist his trips. Petroleum Development Oman
    built the roads from Muscat to the oil-producing area of Fahud, and
    the main trunk road from northern Oman to the new port.

-   The company most involved in these lucrative projects was a
    Palestinian-Lebanese firm, Consolidated Contractors Company (CCC),
    whose patrons were the powerful Omani courtiers Omar and Qais
    Zawawi.

-   Road-building in Oman was a means of connecting Muscat to the
    interior and to the peripheral regions and incorporating the latter
    into the state while undermining their autonomy. The US military and
    its corporate security extensions were also involved in the
    programme of constructing strategic transportation infrastructures
    in Oman.

-   TTI president James Critchfield worked alongside the US Army Corps
    of Engineers to extend the reach of the state into the furthest
    parts of the Omani territory.

-   The US programme of construction was sold to the Omanis as an
    economic boon, and would provide jobs and other economic stimulus,
    and would add to Oman\'s infrastructure.

-   The US Army Corps of Engineers built four Omani/US naval bases in
    Oman, including one in Khasab, which had been a British military or
    naval facility.

-   The Iranian revolution of 1979, the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan,
    and anxiety over instability in Saudi Arabia all influenced
    construction projects.

-   Oman\'s disparate regions have been incorporated into the state\'s
    territorial grasp by building ports which required such hinterland
    constructions. The new port of Duqm, halfway between the existing
    major ports of Salalah and Sohar, has generated some consternation
    among the managers and workers of the other two ports.

-   Intense hostility between the two Yemens belied efforts at
    unification in 1990 and broke into open warfare in 1994. The Chinese
    were a strange mix of peasants, sailors, shepherds, and were working
    on a road between Hodaida and Sanaa.

-   After the Arab uprisings of 2011, regional and global powers
    intervened in Yemen, causing a civil war whose contours do not
    necessarily follow the north-south divide.

-   A Saudi attempt to invade and annex the northern Yemeni port of
    Hodeidah was met with resistance from tribes supporting either Al
    Saud or the imamate, who rode on horseback and were accompanied by
    British and European armed forces driving armed and armoured lorries
    transported on warships.

-   The post-World War II era saw a gradual increase in the length of
    paved roads in Yemen, both in and around Aden Colony and in the
    north. The US, Egypt, the Soviet Union, and Yugoslavia provided aid
    for road-building, and the Cold War further spurred road-building
    efforts.

-   The northern Yemeni government sought US support in road-building,
    and the south had limited connections to other centers of population
    and economic activity due to its long coastline and a few fertile
    but remote areas.

-   South Yemeni rulers appealed to both sides of the Cold War for
    infrastructural aid, but the roads in Yemen are still unpaved and
    the dominance of the north since the unification of the country has
    led to unequal distribution of roads across the country.

-   The United Arab Emirates was the last country in the Arabian
    Peninsula to be woven together by a network of roads, because of the
    wildly variable terrain and because the British were not
    particularly interested in developing the interconnections between
    the Trucial emirates.

-   In the early twentieth century, French scholar Antonin Goguyer
    wanted the French to acquire Khor Fakkan port on the Gulf of Oman
    and build a railway to Sharjah, or to acquire Dibba port and build a
    road to Ras al-Khaimah, but nothing came of this.

-   The unaccommodating topography of the Trucial States meant that
    until the mid-twentieth century, the smaller ports of the eastern
    coast had more intimate commercial ties and connections across the
    seas and along the coasts than to the hinterland emirates that
    claimed them as their own.

-   The Dubai-Sharjah section was built by the Halcrow construction
    firm, while the Sharjah-Ras al-Khaimah road was built by the Saudi
    Bin Laden corporation. This road facilitated the growth of the ports
    on the eastern coast.

-   The federation of the seven emirates that make up the UAE was
    pivotal in the road-building project because it bound the
    peripheries closer to the core and created conduits for Abu Dhabi\'s
    oil and petroleum products.

-   Abu Dhabi\'s political dominance in the UAE after 1971 translated
    into an ambition to extend rail connections across the border from
    the UAE to other countries of the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC).

-   The GCC railway was always a geopolitical project as much as a
    commercial one, and was dependent on high oil prices. A crash in oil
    prices in 2014 and a clash in the foreign-policy imperatives of
    Qatar and Abu Dhabi put paid to the plans.

-   In Oman, the planned peninsular connection is on hiatus, though
    there is talk of a line between Duqm and Fahud, the location of one
    of Petroleum Development Oman\'s main oil fields.

## *Chapter 5, Mechanic, Merchant, King*

-   Dubai Ports World acquired Peninsular and Oriental Steam Navigation
    Company (P&O) for nearly £4 billion in 2006, passing the capitalist
    baton from a company so identified with the British imperial venture
    to a firm embodying state-owned transnational enterprise.

-   P&O was founded in 1837 and became the first major British shipping
    firm to take advantage of steam technology. Its ships carried
    passengers, cargo, and mail through the Mediterranean, the Indian
    Ocean, and beyond.

-   The British India Steam Navigation Company was a major shipping
    company in the Indian Ocean that was founded by a Scottish grocer
    from Argyll. The company was crucial to the consolidation of the
    British Empire in East Africa and western Indian Ocean.

-   British India\'s agent in Aden was Cowasjee Dinshaw & Bros., owned
    by Parsi merchants who expanded their reach through shipping-agency
    work as well as lucrative contracts with the (British) Indian Navy.
    In 1869, Edwyn Dawes foresaw the opening of markets in the Gulf for
    British-owned firms.

-   In 1914, P&O and British India Steam Navigation Company merged under
    the former\'s name. The new chairman was James Mackay, Lord
    Inchcape, the sole surviving partner of Mackinnon Mackenzie.

-   P&O owned more than 500 ships by the mid-1920s, and put them to work
    for the government during the world wars. It then concentrated on
    its cargo trade and expanded into offshore services and port and
    logistics management.

-   The creation of P&O and the absorption of some of its subsidiaries
    by Arab capital is notable in many regards. The transnational firms
    formed intimate relationships with local capital, which in turn
    built up capital through setting up factories, organizing the
    circulation of goods, and providing shipping and agency services.

-   Dubai Ports World, a firm wholly owned by Dubai\'s government
    (and/or ruler), acquired a company that was indelibly marked by the
    history of the British Empire in the Indian Ocean. The boundaries
    between firms and states were blurry for British shipping companies,
    and their interests were indistinguishable from those of the British
    Empire.

-   Although oil created a new class of Arab capitalists, many old
    merchant families comfortably slipped into new modalities of
    accumulation, new sectors, new businesses.

-   For a certain class of European men in the nineteenth century, going
    \'East\' secured prestige, profit, and profession. Today, South
    Asian experts, managers, professionals, and bureaucrats increasingly
    populate the middle and even top tiers of corporate structures.

-   Three shipping firms founded in the Gulf since the start of the
    twentieth century represent different origins, and the changes in
    ownership of shipping capital also illuminate changes and variations
    in maritime property regimes.

-   BP Shipping\'s parent company, Anglo-Persian Oil Company, founded in
    1908 in southwestern Iran, used the SS Ferrara to transport oil. The
    ship\'s capacity was only 1,650 deadweight tons.

-   The production of petroleum increased dramatically in the twentieth
    century, and APOC set up a subsidiary, the British Tanker Company,
    which grew from twenty-five ships to ninety-four ships carrying 1
    million dwt. The company\'s fleet expanded at the same time as the
    consumption of oil increased.

-   The meteoric rise of Greek shipping and the cartoonish glamour of
    the Greek shipping magnates of that era transpired because they
    tapped into oil companies\' hunger for tanker capacity.

-   By the mid-twentieth century, tanker shipping ownership regimes had
    changed, and most oil shippers leased and charter more ships than
    they owned. BP\'s tanker ownership reflected these changes.

-   BP has remained profitable from shipping petroleum, even with
    fluctuations in the price of oil.

-   The British did not want competition from regional shipping
    companies, but Kuwaiti merchants decided to invest in a new shipping
    business in the 1950s, hoping that the new company would order ships
    from British shipyards.

-   Kuwait Oil Tanker Company (KOTC) was founded in 1957 and put its
    ships at the service of the Kuwait Oil Company (a joint venture
    between BP and Gulf Oil), under a time-charter system that
    guaranteed KOTC a stable income over time.

-   In the late 1970s, the closures of the Suez Canal and the
    nationalization of Arab petroleum companies caused tensions in the
    global petroleum shipping business. British Petroleum refused to
    renew its time charter with KOTC, and the company was fully
    nationalized in 1979.

-   KOTC, a tanker company founded by powerful and affluent merchants,
    managed to remain in the black despite the devastation of the
    Kuwaiti oil industry in 1990. It also flourished because of the work
    it did for the Kuwait Oil Company, a BP subsidiary.

-   Oil and gas transport had fallen from over 50 per cent of all
    seaborne trade by volume to just under 30 per cent by 2015, with
    most oil companies ceding their ground to privately owned shippers.

-   The United Arab Shipping Company was founded in 1977 by Saudi
    Arabia, Kuwait, UAE, Bahrain, Iraq, and Qatar, and ordered forty new
    vessels to establish its fleet. Its ambitious start symbolized the
    surging market for maritime shipping in the Peninsula in the 1970s.

-   After the publication of this ranking, UASC began merger talks with
    Hapag-Lloyd, and the deal was completed in 2017. Qatar and Saudi
    Arabia became the fourth- and fifth-largest investors in the new
    company.

-   Secretive family-owned firms, sovereign funds, and state-owned firms
    create complex webs of ownership, echoed in the
    Mackenzie/Mackinnon/Gray/Dawes/Paul shipping network of the late
    nineteenth century.

-   Dubai\'s Port Rashid was built with major British participation,
    including BP, Costain, and Halcrow. Ninety per cent of the financial
    credit was from British sources.

-   If this venture goes well, we should have an excellent lead over our
    competitors for further business with an expanding economy.

-   As late as the 1960s, the British still dominated the construction
    and financing of maritime infrastructures in the lower Gulf. Sir
    William Halcrow & Partners and Sir Bruce White, Wolfe Barry &
    Partners were the most prominent firms.

-   In the 1950s, the British dominated the maritime sector, but the US
    proved a major competitor. Between 1973 and 1981, Indian, South
    Korean, and European firms saw a 580 per cent growth in their
    income.

-   Palestinian contracting firms CAT and CCC had a hand in harbour
    construction in the region, including Aden and Oman, Bahrain and the
    UAE, and Jubail in Saudi Arabia.

-   The fashioning of so much infrastructure was not often without
    friction. Some contractors admitted that the standards of
    construction they adhered to in Arabia were inferior to those they
    obeyed at home, and of course repatriated profits on a grand scale.

-   The Bahraini Petroleum Company (BAPCO) did not allow merchants to
    use their jetty at Sitra, and in Abu Dhabi the oil companies
    discouraged locals from participating in any way other than as hired
    hands. In Saudi Arabia, local firms and businessmen had to fight for
    their share of the oil wealth.

-   Gray Mackenzie was part of a group of shipping companies connected
    to the Mackinnon Group, which gained traction through agency work
    for British India Steam Navigation in Iran and Iraq, Bahrain and
    Kuwait until World War II, when it expanded its staff in Bahrain and
    established a branch in Muscat.

-   The Company represents many Shipping Companies throughout the Gulf
    and handles more than 50 per cent of all tankers entering the Gulf.

-   Gray Mackenzie shifted its focus from agency work to port management
    in the wake of containerisations and transformations in the
    structure of shipping, but localisation regulations in Saudi Arabia
    and Kuwait forced the company to withdraw and re-incorporate.

-   The powerful shipping company of Antonin Besse of Aden relied on its
    agency for Shell Petroleum for the initial expansion of its
    businesses, and made vast profits during World War II.

-   Besse\'s import and export business had branches throughout the Red
    Sea and Indian Ocean, and he also engaged in marine and road
    transport repair, construction, and finance.

-   In the 1950s, local capital was trying different strategies to
    partake of the bounties of infrastructure construction and shipping
    that had so handsomely profited British, US and European firms. Some
    merchants and family-owned firms did all three.

-   Sulaiman Olayan began working for BAPCO and then CASOC in 1936, and
    worked in warehousing for nearly a decade.

-   As a partner in General Contracting Company, Olayan transported
    pipes to the TAPline construction site for Bechtel, and later became
    an agent for Arabian Insurance Company Ltd. He set up a workers\'
    compensation scheme through his insurance company.

-   Ahmad Hamad al-Ghosaibi and his brothers benefitted from Dammam -
    Riyadh railway contracts, and used their profits to found a shipping
    agency and stevedoring business in the burgeoning Dammam port of the
    1950s. They became the most affluent merchant family in eastern
    Saudi Arabia.

-   Long-established merchant families were pitted against European
    businesses in Jeddah, which served the hundreds of thousands of
    pilgrims passing through every year. Agency work gave the local
    families a foothold in the burgeoning new maritime businesses.

-   The last company carries on an extensive import and extensive
    business and does banking on the side. It competes with Gellatly
    Hankey to secure the agencies for various cargo and passenger lines.

-   Yusuf bin Ahmad Kanoo had been APOC\'s agent in Bahrain between 1913
    and 1932, and secured the British mail contract for Bahrain. He also
    became the majority owner of Bahrain Ship-Repairing and Engineering
    Company, and cultivated US military officers to secure major oil
    transport contracts with the US during the Korean War.

-   When Gray Mackenzie was forced to close its offices in Saudi Arabia
    in response to localization edicts, the Kanoo family parlayed their
    presence in Saudi Arabia into a license to manage the Riyadh \'dry
    port\' in the 1970s. The Kanoo family also represented tanker
    businesses calling at Bahrain and Ras Tanura.

-   Many local merchants had to wrench trade away from European
    competitors in order to enter the business realm in the region.
    These merchants benefitted from occupying gaps in transport
    infrastructures which the larger oil or shipping companies could not
    or would not fill.

-   An Iraqi diplomat described him as directing the politics of
    Qatar\'s ruler, and as the main importer, contractor and agent for
    every foreign company. He beat the Anglo-American firms at their own
    game, and made a thorn in foreign companies\' sides.

-   Insurance and banking are fundamental to maritime transport
    infrastructures. How a ship is financed, who fronts the money and on
    what guarantees, and what sorts of insurance decisions and
    calculations are made vary according to legal and political
    contexts.

-   London has long been a hub of expertise in insurance, and Lloyd\'s
    began as a market for maritime insurance in a seventeenth-century
    coffeehouse.

-   The Baltic Exchange and some of the largest maritime law offices are
    based in London. These are direct legacy of colonialism and slave
    trade.

-   Though ships today fly the flags of many registries, many rules,
    regulations and legislations governing global shipping are designed
    in London, Brussels, and Washington.

-   Although metropolitan emanation has been characteristic of modern
    capitalism for centuries, new nodes of finance, insurance, and other
    maritime commercial services have risen in the global South. These
    new nodes are often more closely connected to global networks of
    capital than they are to their brick-and-mortar hinterlands.

-   The transformation of maritime finance has reflected even larger
    socioeconomic changes. The joint stock company was a crucial
    sixteenth-century capitalist innovation that made possible imperial
    maritime fleets and the financing of colonialism itself, and the
    emergence of charter-backed financing in the 1920s.

-   Charter-backed financing entailed a long-term charter for a ship,
    which guaranteed the repayment of the mortgage on the ship. Since
    the 1970s, commercial banks have switched from charter-backed
    financing to asset-backed financing, in effect using the ship itself
    as security for the loan.

-   Asset-backed financing is less restrictive and riskier than
    charter-backed lending because it does not require the certainty of
    future income before credit is extended. When the shipping cycle
    reached its nadir in the mid-1980s, many borrowers defaulted on
    their loans and many ships were repossessed by banks and had to be
    scrapped.

-   The British tightly controlled the establishment of banks in the
    Gulf, and only Aden and Bahrain had depository banks. In Bahrain,
    Eastern Bank was permitted to set up a branch in the 1930s.

-   The British Imperial Bank of Iran was the first local bank to emerge
    in Saudi Arabia, and soon opened branches in Kuwait, Dubai, and
    Oman. It secured a monopoly in these countries for eleven,
    seventeen, and twenty years, respectively.

-   The Palestinian-owned Arab Bank was the first non-Saudi bank to open
    a branch in Saudi Arabia, and BBME opened branches in Al-Khobar,
    Jeddah, Dammam, and Abu Dhabi throughout the 1950s.

-   The bank was wildly successful during its monopoly phase in the
    Gulf, collecting ever-increasing deposits and paying no interest on
    most of its accounts. It also funded the dhow gold trade from Kuwait
    and Dubai to India and guaranteed a loan from Kuwait to cover
    harbour engineering.

-   BBME\'s profits in Oman were mainly secured from the business of
    some twenty merchants of Indian origin who traded with India. After
    the discovery of oil in Oman, BBME financed the construction of
    Sultan Qabus port, today in Muscat town centre.

-   Beirut itself was a beneficiary of Nasser\'s nationalisation of
    Egyptian banks in 1952, and the civil war in Lebanon led many
    maritime financiers and insurers to look to new headquarters in the
    Gulf.

-   Insurance was another important financial service required for
    shipping. The British empire spread the peculiarities of the English
    insurance business worldwide, and Indian Ocean business diasporas
    transmitted these new forms of calculation and finance to new
    shores.

-   Most insurance companies in the Arabian Peninsula were local
    franchises or agencies of European firms until the 1960s.

-   Almost all insurance contracts indemnified cargo and maritime trade,
    and the insurance industry grew in leaps and bounds in the 1970s.
    However, Europe continues to be the hub of global marine insurance,
    and Lloyd\'s of London earns the largest percentage of all forms of
    marine insurance.

-   Dubai is the only Arab port to appear on a report on world shipping
    centres.

-   The concentration of P&I clubs in the UK has notably affected
    shipping in and around the Arabian Peninsula. The Joint War
    Committee, other insurance underwriters, and members of the
    International Underwriting Association determine the world shipping
    hotspots and issue a list that enumerates wars, strikes, terrorism,
    piracy, and other possible risks.

-   In the 1950s and 1960s, many local advisers to the rulers were
    prominent merchants or officers in many of the new businesses. Easa
    al-Gurg was appointed a member of the Dubai Port Committee in 1961.

-   Mahdi al-Tajir was seconded to Dubai to establish a customs service,
    and Ahmad bin Sulayem became al-Tajir\'s deputy. Sulayem\'s son,
    Sultan, became the chairman of DP World.

-   In Kuwait, a great many Palestinian and Egyptian professionals
    populated the ranks of the civil services, but in the lower Gulf,
    British advisers were forced on local rulers to run the police, the
    health department, finance, water, the Post Office, electricity.

-   Charles Belgrave, a twenty-six year old hired by the Colonial Office
    to serve as the adviser to the Bahraini ruler, employed underhand,
    even fraudulent, methods to surreptitiously purchase local land for
    a British naval base in Jufair. He remained in Bahrain until the
    late 1950s, when popular protest demanded his ouster.

-   Aramco tried to shape the Saudi ruling family\'s institutions and
    structures, and nationalist Arab technocrats found themselves in a
    political wilderness.

-   Foreign advisers and their firms helped establish new government
    offices, modern commercial infrastructures, and novel economic and
    social organisations in the Arabian Peninsula. These institutions
    brought with them new management practices and organisational
    structures, as well as new regimes of labour, new modalities of
    hierarchy, and novel debt facilities.

-   The Gulf already had a handful of smaller ship repair yards, but
    with the advent of VLCCs and ULCCs, many of them were incapable of
    serving the megaships.

-   A former managing director for a Niarchos shipping business proposed
    a project to the Saudi government for the construction of a drydock
    that could service the megaships that were multiplying in the wake
    of the closure of Suez Canal.

-   The project to build a VLCC ship in Bahrain involved a significant
    number of international participants, including Lisnave of Portugal,
    various British shipbuilders and shipyard managers, and German,
    Spanish, and French architects, shipyards, and construction firms.

-   The drydock started operations in 1977, and was controversial
    because Dubai was bypassed. The timing had everything to do with the
    British withdrawal from the Gulf in 1971 and the Arab oil
    producers\' fear of Iran\'s claims on Bahrain.

-   Although much was said about how the drydock provided jobs and
    technical training for Arabs, the organization has always been
    managed by Europeans.

-   LinkedIn is useful as a research tool in maritime businesses because
    it clearly reveals a few trends in the management of ports. The most
    important trend is the movement of technical and managerial experts
    from shipping hubs in the global North to the Middle East.

-   Oman\'s ports are operated by a joint venture between the Omani
    government and the Port of Rotterdam, and the container terminal is
    managed by Hutchison, a Hong Kong-based firm.

-   The container-terminal manager for the port of Salalah is a
    consortium led by the Dutch/Danish APM Terminals, with a British CEO
    and a US-educated Dhofari as deputy. The harbourmaster is a former
    captain of the Indian Navy.

-   The technopolitics of port management involves automation
    technologies, algorithmic security, supply-chain streamlining, and a
    degree of fantasy. Security experts conjure fantastic monsters of
    terrorism, violence, and insecurity, and offer equally fantastical
    solutions. After Dubai Ports World\'s bid for the management of six
    US ports was rejected, professors of management and political
    science argued that terror threats lurked everywhere. They suggested
    expanding the inspection power of the Coast Guard, improving the
    distribution of commercial information, and enhancing international
    cooperation.

-   The security concerns of maritime transportation shape the
    commercial landscape by influencing transnational regulations, the
    routing of goods through particular gateway ports or passage points,
    data surveillance, labour discipline and risk management algorithms.

-   The vast majority of newfangled technologies are chimerical,
    including the hyperloop, a form of transportation which travels
    through a fully sealed tube, operating free of friction.

-   Another fantasy technology is the blockchain. It is an encrypted
    block of data that links to one another to provide a full record of
    all transactions from the first moment of interaction.

-   The blockchain, like so many technologies before it, is seen as the
    panacea to problems that plague the supply chain. However, the
    extent to which these technologies transform practices at ports and
    terminals can only be measured years after their implementation.

## *Chapter 6, Landside Labour*

-   C.L. Tucker upon his arrival in Aden (Nov. 48) had to deal with a
    strike that had begun in AIOC and at the port on the 16^th^ of Nov,
    which went on until December,

-   Tucker's account of the strikes was an account labour mobilizations
    and the response and actions to it by oil and shipping companies,
    port operators, colonial officials, and Adenese people as well. This
    strike can be seen as a precursor to the major mobilizations of the
    50s and the anti-colonial struggles of the 60s. The strike that took
    place at Aden in Nov. was a wage labour strike -- workers were being
    severely underpaid. This was also in light of Post Trust strikes.

-   With the strike ensuing, a deal was struck with AIOC, but not with
    other workers for other port companies.

-   AIOC, it seems, treated their port workers better than the shipping
    companies themselves; calling the police to arrest and beat the
    strikers. Similarly, Cowasjee Dinshaw was a shipping company owned
    by an Indian Parsi who was worried about 'white man's prestige.' The
    Corney Commission and the 1948 strike took place while a labour
    govt. was in charge in London at the time. Most of AIOC's shares
    were held by the British govt.

-   Labour unions were much more appreciated within the British govt. as
    trade unions could serve as anti-communist vessels and could also
    function as anti-decolonial forms. The world depended on the
    movement of petroleum and ships and between the cooperation of
    managers and labourers.

-   The strike bares resemblance to how colonialism seeped into a modern
    work environment; where workers are creating racial hierarchies
    against themselves and other workers. In the reports of the strikes
    Somali's were viewed as the most difficult to work with, and that
    the hardworking, clever, unimaginative Indian and Pakistani workers
    were a stark contrast to the politically woke Palestinians.

-   Much of the labour workforce was made of migratory bodies.
    Longstanding ties of migration in the region provided workers
    throughout the various ports. These ties were appendages of the
    state and imperial powers. Such as the British moving workers around
    within their plantations and colonies. Similarly, at times the
    movement migrants was also withheld through passports, citizenship,
    visa, labour permits, kafala, sponsorship systems, and quotas.

-   Strikers were supported by other merchants during this period, such
    as Taxi drivers, and street sweepers who went on strike in
    solidarity. The Sultan of Lahej had supported them with food and
    some financial stability (he was also under British protection) as
    well as Shaikh Abdullah (aka Abdullah al-Asnaj, he was also later
    the founder of the Aden Trade Union Congress and the People
    Socialist Party.

-   "Aden, more than any other city on the Peninsula, was the stage on
    which labour revolt illuminated the contours of labour formation and
    the disciplining mechanisms used by the state, the empire, and by
    capital to contain it." (186)

-   It was a port that was dependent on global networks of shipboard
    labour.

-   The workspaces across harbours changed with the developments of coal
    to oil, as well as to tankers and then container ships. Much of the
    labour conducted in loading docks was extremely laborious, and
    loading and unloading shifts could last up to 17 hours. In the 1970s
    much of the workers in the Gulf were migrants from Iran,
    Baluchistan, or Pakistan. Much of the ports were unproductive in
    terms of output -- this was largely due to much of the work being
    subcontracted (so that companies could have a reason to not give
    better wages and benefits).

-   Nationality played a role into what rights workers could demand or
    not. This made foreign workers deportable. Foreign workers were
    responsible for building the ports infrastructure, but not for
    handling its equipment and machinery.

-   While automation had been normalized in the petroleum transportation
    sector, it took years for Middle Eastern ports to containerize.

-   In Khor Fakkan port, fearless men climb atop stacks of containers on
    ships, using a flexible pole to unlock one box\'s corners from the
    other below it.

-   Although many Peninsula cargo ports speak of plans for automation,
    they will still require drivers, technical operators, cleaners, and
    maintenance workers. The tension will be refracted through
    racialized regimes of labour.

-   Workers who build port infrastructures and make them function have
    lives outside their workplace. Many of them cannot afford their own
    housing and are forced to live in labour camps that are more easily
    monitored and controlled.

-   Abdulrahman Munif\'s magisterial petronovel has searing accounts of
    \'company towns\' in Saudi Arabia in which housing was segregated by
    \'race\' or nationality. On Abu Dhabi\'s Das Island, the same system
    of segregated and racialized housing obtained.

-   The postwar decades saw a boom in construction of major
    infrastructures in the Arabian Peninsula, but the living conditions
    were woeful and the workers went on strike. Today, labour camps
    segregate \'bachelor\' migrant workers from the population, and
    entry to some city spaces are heavily regulated.

-   Marcel van der Linden argues that modern forms of labour management
    have their origins in the management of unfree labour in the
    colonies.

-   The world of manual work on ports follows hierarchies that conform
    to the global color line. Skilled workers come from the Philippines
    or India, while semiskilled workers come from the more prosperous
    states of India.

-   Iranians were the migrant category working at the harbours before
    mechanization. The discovery of oil shifted both work and migration
    patterns within the Gulf, and the Persians abandoned agriculture,
    pearling, and fishing and moved to the oil fields and the ports that
    brought in cargoes and exported petroleum and refined products.

-   Seafarers and pearlers from Kuwait and Bahrain were the first to
    enter the oil industry, but many other seafarers from the lower Gulf
    got jobs as coolies or construction workers in Kuwait.

-   The British tried to control the movement of people by requiring
    hard-to-obtain visas, but it was still very simple for Arabs in
    neighboring areas to immigrate to Bahrain and assume Bahraini
    nationality.

-   The Kanoo shipping magnates of Bahrain wrote that the oil companies
    devoured so many of the available workers that they had to rely on
    recruiting labour from the Trucial States (now the UAE) and Oman.
    The governments of the receiving countries sought out replacement
    categories of workers that could be more easily disciplined.

-   Historically, \'native\' workers on the Peninsula had been
    considered part of the life of the cities. Modern states invented
    categories to classify and control workers.

-   Arab workers were often imported from other states to replace native
    workers, but their rights were often defended by their home
    governments.

-   If Arab workers proved problematic, they could be replaced by
    workers from countries further afield whose governments might not be
    as vociferous in protecting their migrant worker citizens.

-   The colonization of Palestine and the expulsion of Palestinians
    spurred the rulers of the Gulf to hire Palestinians, especially
    those with skills and English language proficiency, and also as a
    means of encouraging Palestinian resettlement.

-   Ibn Saud\'s hiring of Palestinians proved a boon to Aramco and his
    US patrons.

-   Aramco\'s official company records show that Palestinians made up 2
    per cent of the workers building the port of Dammam in 1949 and 17
    per cent in 1950.

-   In 1951, Pakistanis and Indians constituted 6.1 and 4.7 per cent of
    the workforce, respectively, in contrast to Palestinians, who
    constituted only 4.3 per cent.

-   Palestinians made their way to the Gulf legally or illegally, often
    walking for fifteen to twenty hours across the desert to reach
    villages from which they could make their way to Mosul, Baghdad, and
    Basra. Many were abandoned by unscrupulous guides and died of
    exposure.

-   In the 1950s, Yemenis were a strong presence in the political
    groupings of the Gulf that called for economic and political
    transformation throughout the Peninsula. Many Yemenis became boat
    pilots, stevedores, and other maritime professions in the Gulf
    cities.

-   The discovery of oil in the Trucial Coast in the 1960s encouraged
    the migration of foreigners to work on the infrastructure projects
    there.

-   In 1968, 51 per cent of the population and 67 per cent of the
    workforce in Dubai were foreigners, with 83 per cent of all workers
    hailing from Iran and South Asia.

-   In many countries, the state responded to protests by restricting
    employment to nationals and importing migrant labourers from
    countries whose states did not noisily defend them as republican
    Arab governments did.

-   The British worked closely with the major oil companies to control
    the flow of migrants from South Asia, and a draconian visa system
    was decreed into law between the 1950s and 1970s.

-   The kafala system, which had originally grown out of pearling work,
    was adapted by states and booming businesses of the upper Gulf in
    this early stage, and became an encompassing system of exploitation,
    which disadvantaged South Asian workers by withholding their
    passports and isolating them from the cities in which they lived.

-   Pakistani and Lebanese workers protested against French supervisors,
    the hiring of skilled Somali workers, and wages that were kept
    artificially low in Dubai and Oman. The government of Oman deported
    the leaders of the strikes and the workers were abandoned in an area
    with little telecommunications, living amenities, or connections
    with locals.

-   Asian workers on Khasab suffered abandonment and forced isolation,
    as well as brutal employers who often refused to pay on time (or
    ever), uncaring home states, and a host state which only attended to
    the migrant workers\' protests.

-   When Saudization plans were introduced, thousands of migrant workers
    were sacked without any recourse and went without several months of
    wages. The government of India repatriated these workers.

-   In 2015, foreigners accounted for the majority of the population in
    Bahrain, Kuwait, Qatar, and the UAE. South Asians outnumbered all
    other foreigners in these countries.

-   It is difficult to track down how many migrant workers are employed
    in the maritime or port businesses, as the sending countries and the
    employers either do not have aggregate statistics or jealously guard
    such information. However, in my own experience of different ports
    of the Peninsula, certain migrant communities dominated particular
    categories of jobs. In spring 2018, Hutchison began advertising for
    Saudi women to train for gantry-crane operation. The advertisement
    required no prior experience and only a secondary-school diploma.

-   Protests in the Gulf from the 1940s onwards are less familiar to
    Anglophone readers than protests in Aramco and Bahrain, and strikes
    in Qatar and Abu Dhabi are less familiar than strikes in Bahrain and
    colonial Aden.

-   Dock workers on the Arabian Peninsula often justified their demands
    for better working conditions, rights, and dignity as being not only
    about bread-and-butter issues but also about politics. This perhaps
    explains why the Gulf monarchies were so terrified of workplace
    agitation.

-   Aramco striker Madawi al-Rasheed wrote about his life at the
    company, including meeting people from Asir and other parts of Najd.
    The food was awful, but the Najdis would not say anything.

-   In the 1950s, workers began to demand things from Aramco, but they
    did not respond to the demand for political rights.

-   In Aden, during an Aden Port Trust dockers\' strike, the workers
    demanded paid transport to Britain once every five years. They also
    protested against the quality of food and the dramatically unequal
    rates of pay.

-   General strikes were called in 1950s Bahrain to get rid of the
    arrogantly autocratic Sir Charles Belgrave, who was also a symbol of
    British military aggression against Bahrainis\' Arab brethren. The
    leaders of the strike were detained, put on a show trial, and exiled
    to St Helena.

-   After the 1956 Suez War, workers at Ahmadi port in Kuwait and Aden
    went on strike, and in April 1963, dockworkers in Qatar went on
    strike in jubilation, supported by nationalist merchants, and
    reinforced by armed tribesmen drafted in from the interior.

-   The 1963 Qatari strikes were sandwiched between general strikes in
    1961 and 1968, and the 1965 Das Island strike was notable for the
    solidarity of Abu Dhabian workers across nationalities.

-   After the 1967 war, protests in Al-Khobar, Dammam, Ras Tanura,
    Qatif, and Dhahran attacked the US consulate and air field there,
    and in April 1970, thirty-four Indian/Pakistani labourers stopped
    work after discovering a metal tag bearing the imprint of a
    six-point star.

-   In the late 1940s, Aramco deported a man to Aden via Bahrain because
    he had made inflammatory and communistic speeches. The Bahraini left
    helped organize strikes throughout the postwar decades which wove
    together workplace demands and political mobilization.

-   When Pakistani and Indian workers went on strike in Muscat in June
    1965, thirty-three Pakistanis thought to be the leaders were
    \'repatriated\' by the company.

-   No labour force was safe in the Arab Gulf, where pan-Arabist and
    Communist fervor were increasingly suppressed by repressive and
    authoritarian non-oil-producing Arab regimes which were
    simultaneously liberalizing their economies. The Iranian Revolution
    did not find the same kind of organic sympathy with labor movements
    in the Gulf.

-   Port workers in the Peninsula faced the most gargantuan obstacles to
    protest, including casualization of labor and increased distances
    between ports and city centers.

-   Despite barriers to mobilization, the archives teem with accounts of
    protest, including strikes and labour withdrawals. Direct action,
    including machine-breaking, violence, and rioting, was far more
    frequent thereafter, when the full force of repressive measures
    against labour strikes had circumscribed protest in almost all
    Peninsula countries.

-   Non-European workers employed by the contractors went on strike at
    the Jebel Dhanna oil terminal and at Tarif, and the strike petered
    out in June after local state authorities were prodded into action.

-   The Qatari oil workers\' general strike was sparked off by
    demonstrations approving the tripartite declaration on unity signed
    in Cairo by Egypt, Syria and Iraq. The oil workers tried
    unsuccessfully to solicit support from the oil workers in Bahrain
    and Abu Dhabi.

-   The rulers\' security forces deployed indiscriminate violence
    against the workers at every turn, providing an alibi for their
    British and American patrons. Torture was rife in the prisons of the
    Peninsula and beatings were doled out at the workplace, during
    strikes, in worker barracks, and on city streets.

-   Nepalese logistics workers were ambushed and killed while hauling
    goods from Kuwait to US forward operating bases deep within Iraq.
    Their families sought justice from the US court system, but their
    case was eventually thrown out on procedural grounds.

-   Human rights organizations have taken up the cause of the workers in
    the absence of trade unions, but naming and shaming only goes so
    far.

-   The rulers in the region resisted calls for labour unions, but the
    British pushed for the institution of trade unions in Bahrain, Aden,
    and Kuwait. The British unions had been \'anti-Communist by
    conviction\' and hostile to any idea of using strikes as political
    weapons.

-   In both Bahrain and Aden, unions were originally established as
    vertical, or company, unions rather than sector-wide unions, as
    demanded by the representatives of the workers themselves. In
    Kuwait, an amendment to the Labour Law allowed foreign workers to
    join the unions.

-   In Kuwait, the nationals wanted unity between Kuwaiti and foreign
    workers, and compared the legal distinctions to South African
    apartheid.

-   Although the new law limited foreign worker participation in trade
    unions to non-voting and non-officiating membership, national unions
    are increasingly engaging in alliances with unions representing
    foreign workers that are based in their home countries.

-   By the late 1960s, the British had changed their position towards
    labour unions in the Gulf protectorates, and the US labour attaché
    in Beirut suggested that the British may want to put into place
    unions before they left.

-   A labour union was formed at the port of Salalah in 2009, but due to
    political constraints and repressive political measures, it focused
    on \'strong dialogue and sound negotiations\'. The unions were
    making a Faustian bargain by invoking the state as a patron and
    protector.

-   Under British colonial rule, the oil and shipping companies,
    terminal operators, and logistics firms looked to the state to
    unleash violence against protesters, and openly called for brutal
    police action against workers.

-   The states used various forms of punishment to control labour,
    including black-legging strikers, intrusive surveillance, and police
    beatings, detentions, and violence. Deportation of foreign workers
    and exile of labour activists were also used, but there was a danger
    associated with exiling labour leaders.

-   In the years of ferment of the 1950s and 1960s, protests that could
    halt the production and circulation of oil rattled oil companies,
    governments, and colonial officers. The Qatari police violently
    suppressed the protests, but the tanks at Umm Said were full after
    two days. Occupy activists used counter-logistical tactics at the
    port chokepoints to create a new modality of activism in 2011,
    preventing the smooth flow of oil.

-   Pro-Palestinian activists blocked Israeli Zim ships unloading at the
    port of Oakland in 2014, mimicking earlier transnational
    solidarities of dockers refusing to unload apartheid South Africa\'s
    ships. Port blockades have been successful in the past in drawing
    attention to international campaigns, but ultimately are only a set
    of tactics. They can be appropriated for less than salutary
    politics.

-   The Seafarers International Union and the International
    Longshoremen\'s Association picketed the SS Cleopatra in New York in
    April 1960, and Nasser himself declared this an action in sympathy
    with Israel. Arab trade unions sent messages of protest to the two
    US-based unions.

-   The press reported that 3,000 American tourists in Israel for the
    holiday season today gathered at a reception in Hamlin House in Tel
    Aviv and adopted a resolution congratulating the New York maritime
    workers and longshoremen for their boycott of United Arab Republic
    shipping in New York Harbor.

## *Chapter 7, Shipboard Work*

-   Astute analysts like C.L.R. James and Michel Foucault have seen in
    the ship a kind of affirmative topoi: the former a utopia, the
    latter a heterotopia. But the ship is as far from an autonomous,
    self-constituted, sovereign working class as one can imagine.

-   Yet his brief essay suddenly veers into a romantic finale, which
    ignores the fact that the imaginative life on the ship is founded on
    a substratum of mind-numbing, boring, repetitive labour for
    everyone, including the officers, and back-breaking toil for the
    seafarers.

-   Marcus Rediker\'s excavation of the historical etymology of
    \'spinning the yarn\' points to the continuity of monotony and
    hardship on the ship from the age of sail to the age of steam. The
    crew lived in close, forced proximity and the captains created
    \'\'make-work\'\' of various kinds to fill the porous workday.

-   The lower a seafarer is in the hierarchy of the ship, the more
    repetitive, tedious, and menial the work is. There is no exposure to
    sun and sea air, and no yarns to spin.

-   The work of machinists onboard ships can include standing under a
    storm of rust and paint flakes, necks craned backwards as overhead
    beams are scraped and scrubbed, and using hand-held jackhammers to
    dislodge rust and create sound.

-   The oil-purifying room is a hot, humid inferno at the heart of the
    engine room, where artisanal skill is required to fix damaged pieces
    that run an awesomely powerful engine.

-   In the wheelhouse, many of the tasks are deadly tedious. Admiralty
    Charts need to be regularly updated, and endless reams of paperwork
    have to be filled out. Crew members who stare out to sea to look for
    boats that may not be picked up by radar or the Automatic
    Identification System became more focused, tenser, and could see
    through the haze and heat and shimmer of the Indian Ocean boats,
    porpoises, buoys that it took me at least another five minutes to
    identify.

-   Piracy is a business, and the people who ran the racket were likely
    dressed in suits and drove shiny big SUVs in Nairobi or Singapore or
    another cyber-connected and well-to-do regional capital. The pirates
    were exploited by those distant \'businessmen\'.

-   Crew members told me that tankers and bulk carriers felt less safe
    going through pirate seas than fortified ro/ros or tall container
    ships, and that the flag under which the ship steamed made some
    ships more vulnerable to piracy and some more protected by naval
    escorts.

-   Port visits are not tedious, but exhausting and stressful. The
    turnaround time at the port is perennially diminishing, and the
    stressful navigation of ships through congested channels to port is
    no way to break the boredom.

-   My ship was the first ultra-large container vessel to arrive at the
    port of Mersin in Turkey after an expansion of the port and the
    deepening of the approach channel. The captain visibly tensed during
    the navigation to shore.

-   Arrival at port was no moment of rest for the seafarers. They had to
    work with the dockers and stevedores and crane operators to ensure
    the smooth lading and unlading of the ship with containers, bulk
    goods, or liquid cargo.

-   Some ports are off limits to visiting seafarers, such as the ports
    of Saudi Arabia and Khor Fakkan, and some shipping companies may not
    permit their seafarers to go ashore because of often nebulous or
    outdated security fears.

-   The ship is often physically arranged in a way that reflects the
    pyramidical character of order and discipline onboard, with the
    captain having his own floor and expansive seating areas, while the
    crew members have to share their spaces with at least one other
    person.

-   Filipino seafarers used to ask for karaoke equipment aboard ships,
    but now they retreat to their cabins to browse the internet, watch
    porn, or contact their families. The new access to internet was
    something for which the officers and crew members were grateful.

-   Anthropologist Johanna Markkula writes about how crew members
    retreated into their cabins during times of tension aboard the ship,
    and how the bifurcated contracting system also meant more divergent
    wage systems between officers and crews of the world\'s biggest
    shipping companies.

-   The dual-wage system, in which officers of European extraction get
    paid one rate and work on more amenable contracts, has a precedent
    in the work of lascars, who were seafarers from the European
    colonies who served on merchant vessels owned by the European.

-   Lascars were employed on British and other European ships to work as
    deck hands and cabin boys. Their employment was about the racial
    hierarchies of labour that structured colonial regimes of
    exploitation.

-   In 1823, laws were specifically promulgated against lascars that
    denied their Britishness for employment purposes and endorsed their
    employment at discriminatory wages and conditions.

-   The National Union of Seamen of Britain discriminated against
    lascars, claiming that they were not British. The Merchant Shipping
    Act of 1906 legislated for expanded accommodation space and improved
    diet for English seafarers, but explicitly excluded lascars.

-   In 1919, laws were passed to deport unemployed lascars from Britain,
    even though they were British subjects. In 1925, all \'colored\'
    seamen had to register with the police, and many were forcibly
    shipped to India.

-   The British government subsidized tramp shipping during the
    Depression, but the NUS and its allied unions demanded that no
    subsidy be given to shipping companies that hired \'non-domiciled
    Asiatics and other colored seamen\'.

-   Adenese lascars were first recruited by the French Messageries
    Maritimes in 1869, who had a fortnightly mail service bunkering at
    Aden and required the seafarers to carry their British discharge
    books or police identity cards.

-   Adenese lascars were taken onboard as firemen or stokers on British
    merchant vessels, but in the early twentieth century, increasingly
    draconian entry requirements were introduced in many ports around
    the world, which made it harder for lascars to jump ship.

-   The 1948 Adenese strike, which immobilized the port, was attributed
    to the cumulative force of preceding protests, and to the fact that
    Arab and Somali seafaring workers who had seen conditions in other
    ports and obtained higher wages communicated this knowledge to their
    fellow workers in Aden.

-   The 1919 Aliens Restriction (Amendment) Act resulted in Adenese and
    Punjabi lascars being rounded up and deported to India or Aden. They
    insisted on land leave in Aden, on halal meat, and on the immediate
    payment of their debts.

-   Indian seafarers were considered seditious Communists because they
    could transmit ideas of revolt and bring news of mobilization. They
    were also thought to have been involved in gun-running and
    dissemination of clandestine or prohibited publications.

-   In 1928, a police informant wrote to the British authorities in Aden
    about how a ship\'s agent travelled throughout Britain on behalf of
    Imam Yahya\'s struggle against the British. He requested all Arabs
    to help Imam Yehia Zaide with money.

-   The community of seafarers in Britain revolted in response to
    discriminatory legislation and racist union activism against them.

-   By the late 1930s, Communist-led organizations specifically aimed to
    recruit among non-white seafarers. When the Royal Indian Navy
    mutinied in 1946, they found solidarity across the seas, and the
    anticolonial revolt eventually faded into the ravages of capitalist
    retrenchment in the 1970s.

-   The constant hardships of the sea life took their toll on the
    sailors, who were grey and looked old.

-   In the wake of decolonization in the 1960s, the 1970s saw the
    nationalization of oil and the OPEC cartel, the reversal of
    social-democratic gains, and the consolidation of authoritarianism.

-   Container shipping had become a welcomed technological modality, and
    oil extraction and circulation had also changed. Large ships were
    built, and Euro-American oil companies accelerated their divestment
    from their shipping businesses.

-   The economic and political upheavals were transmitted to seafarers\'
    bodies and daily lives by twofold means: automation, the whittling
    down of work forces on the docks and aboard ships, and the
    acceleration of turnaround times at ports.

-   Automation was a built-in feature of tanker loading from very early
    on, which reduced the cost of stevedoring at ports and made tankers
    a more attractive venture for shipowners. Three operators were
    required for siphoning oil aboard with as few as six men.

-   In 1967, McKinsey Consulting advised London ports to model their
    container-shipping businesses on the VLCC and ULCC business.

-   The regime of work aboard tankers was, from very early on, uncannily
    similar to labour on automated container ships. The consolidation of
    bulk cargo in containers has created the conditions of automation at
    sea and at ports which tankers had pioneered.

-   To sail under a flag of convenience means to avoid taxes and
    insurance, and to pay wages attractive to ship-owners.

-   In the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, ships of the East India
    Company flew the red Arab flag to avoid confrontation with French
    privateers. In the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries,
    slaving ships from the Arabian Peninsula flew French flags in order
    to avoid having to submit to British maritime inspections. The
    British used this as an alibi to harass and stop ships flying the
    French flag.

-   The Panamanian open registry was established in 1916 and allows any
    ship to be registered to Panama through a Panamanian consul at a
    foreign port. The owner is relieved of the continual but irregular
    boiler and hull inspections.

-   Aristotle Onassis used Panamanian registry to hire whom he wanted
    aboard his ships at wages not comparable to those of other tanker
    companies.

-   The Liberian registry was established in 1948 under the auspices of
    the former US Secretary of State and ambassador to the United
    Nations, Edward Stettinius. The registry was a private firm,
    operated by Stettinius and his business partners, and headquartered
    in the US state of Virginia.

-   The first ship registered under the Liberian flag was owned by
    Stavros Niarchos and chartered to Getty Oil of California.

-   The processes of cost-cutting, the trough in shipping business, and
    national deregulations in the 1970s saw an exponential expansion of
    ships sailing under flags of convenience.

-   From the 1970s onwards, foreign crews on ships proliferated, and
    some countries began to specialize in supplying shipboard labour. In
    2015, China, the Philippines, the Russian Federation, Ukraine, and
    India were the five largest suppliers of officers and crew.

-   Arbitrage on the international wages of crews earns shipowners
    handsome profits, but many seafarers have fallen prey to
    unscrupulous shipowners who abandon sailors aboard faulty vessels in
    foreign ports, with no pay and no way to return home.

-   Ships have always been international spaces, but today\'s
    internationalization is different. This results in less worker
    cohesion aboard ships compared to landside workers.

-   Seafarers\' weakening ability to strike is reflected in the
    statistics of the Strike Club, which insures against maritime
    strikes and delays caused by port closures and accidents.

-   The MV Saudi Independence was an East German ship built sometime in
    the 1950s, which was acquired from East Germany by a Saudi shipping
    firm based in Jeddah in the late 1970s. The owners demanded such
    deep cost-cutting from their captain that the vessel had become a
    hunger ship.

-   The crew had to improvise making a fish net to supplement their
    meagre rations of food with fish, but the shipowner ordered more
    savings and limitations on food supply.

-   The Filipino crew members at last revolted and went on strike, but
    Orri Navigation Lines brought a suit to force them to terminate
    their strike and for ITF to cease representing them. The Court of
    Cassation dismissed the appeal.

-   The workers aboard the hunger ship are erased out of the history
    entirely, and Orri Lines still thrives.

## *Chapter 8 and (epilogue), The Bounties War*

-   The British Foreign Office commissioned a report from British
    Petroleum and Shell on the shipping of oil from the Middle East,
    which indicated that the canal could not keep up with increasing oil
    production.

-   A few months after the British, French, and Israeli forces invaded
    Sinai, the Suez Canal was closed, and ships carrying oil from the
    Middle East had to round the Cape of Good Hope.

-   Europe changed, with higher tea prices and factory closures. Many
    people moved to New Zealand, Australia, and Canada.

-   The US slapped Britain and France on the wrist for the invasion, but
    brought ships out of mothballs to transport coal and petroleum to
    Europe and specifically to the UK.

-   The canal closure saw an intensified interest in pipeline
    construction, and the urgent need for more efficient cargo transport
    accelerated the containerization process that had begun in the early
    1950s. The long route around Africa avoided the nationalist
    government of Egypt.

-   Nasser closed the Suez Canal to all traffic on 6 June, increasing
    the overall cost of a voyage from the Persian Gulf to Britain and
    Western Europe by as much as \$20,000.

-   The Times estimated that half of the fifty ships passing through the
    Suez Canal in 1966 were oil tankers. The cost of purchasing tankers
    had already increased, and the shipping rates for some tankers
    carrying oil had doubled, but the prices on routes returned to
    pre-war levels.

-   The 1967 closure of the Suez Canal resulted in a loss of markets for
    India and Pakistan, but a boon for South Africa. Innovative
    oil-swapping models were invented to accommodate the route closures.

-   The port of Rotterdam encouraged and subsidized the construction of
    refineries, bulk liquid and petrochemical terminals, and other
    downstream port infrastructures in response to the supposed oil
    boycott against Western countries.

-   The June war ended the era of decolonization in the Arab world, as
    the Soviet Navy was about to establish supremacy in the Red Sea, and
    the regimes on both shores would have been due for realignment or
    replacement.

-   The counterrevolutionary and reactionary forces that served the
    imperial powers got the upper hand in 1967, and despite bombastic
    speeches about an oil boycott, the New York Times observed that oil
    shipments to Europe had never been higher.

-   During the 1973 war, Israeli aircrafts and warships struck the
    Mediterranean ports of Latakia and Tartus in Syria, causing damage
    that led to ships being diverted to the port of Shuwaikh in Kuwait
    for transshipment by trucks to Jordan, Syria, and Iraq.

-   The 1973 war was a harbinger of the Lebanese civil war, which had
    constantly shifting alliances, unpredictable fits and starts, and
    accumulating uncertainty around how it might end.

-   Once the Beirut docks were burned down by the Phalange militia in
    1975, each warlord set up his own port along the coast.

-   Businesses were skittish about staying in Beirut, so Bechtel moved
    its Beirut staff to Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, and Jordan.

-   Kuwait, Dubai, Sharjah, and Bahrain were major beneficiaries of the
    banking and insurance sectors deserting Beirut. Kuwait and Dubai
    competed with each other for capital and banks from Kuwait and Saudi
    Arabia who no longer could route their businesses through Beirut.

-   The massive rerouting of petrodollars from Beirut to the Gulf
    resulted in a frenzy of construction and consumption, with the
    attendant exponential increase in imports, which further heated the
    economies of the port cities.

-   The nationalization of oil companies and the cartelization of OPEC
    led to the entry of the oil-producing states into transport. They
    founded their own shipping companies and placed large orders with
    East Asian shipyards for new VLCC and ULCCs.

-   The seas surrounding the Peninsula were thick with tankers in the
    1970s, but the Iran - Iraq War changed this. In the early 1980s,
    Dubai\'s trade with Iran grew by 40 per cent.

-   Shippers from other nations became hesitant about travelling to
    Iraqi or Iranian Gulf ports because of the staggering increase in
    insurance rates for ships in the war zone.

-   In 1984, France delivered five Super Étendard planes and an armory
    of Exocet missiles to Iraq, which used them to attack ships loading
    at Iran\'s Kharg Terminal.

-   The Iranian regime began attacking Kuwaiti tankers, and Iraq and
    Iran attacked fifty-eight and nineteen tankers, respectively. The
    response was an increase in insurance and freight rates for tanker
    transport throughout the whole of the Gulf.

-   Kuwait approached China, France, the US, and the Soviet Union to
    reflag Kuwaiti tankers, and the US reflagged ten Kuwait crude
    vessels and four LPG carriers. The convoys themselves fell victim to
    mines.

-   In 1988, Iran and Iraq had attacked ships 411 times, with Iraq
    responsible for 60 per cent of the attacks.

-   The US military lawyer Michael Snipes pointed out that reflagging
    the Kuwaiti tankers went against two different legal determinations,
    and that the US had no legal basis to interfere with Iranian attacks
    on Kuwaiti tankers because Kuwait had by its action become party to
    war.

-   Snipes argued that US law forbade flags of convenience on coastal
    trade, but US law was malleable in the service of power, and US
    sovereign power was extended overseas.

-   The political and maritime landscape emerging from the Iran - Iraq
    war was the setting for the Desert Shield/Desert Storm operations.
    Kuwaiti businesses fled the invasion to Jabal Ali, and Dubai Ports
    World rented office space to Kuwait Petroleum Corporation.

-   For the US, Desert Shield/Desert Storm was an occasion to flaunt its
    hegemony and military\'s logistical reach and prowess across the
    world.

-   In 1990, US military and chartered civilian aircrafts transported
    personnel and smaller and more compact items to the battlefields\'
    staging areas. Ships hauled millions of tons of cargo from ports
    around the world to the countries of the Gulf.

-   The ports of Dammam and Jubail became the staging ground for US
    forces, and local shipping agencies served the US Navy in handling
    military materiel and securing marine insurance. The newly
    constructed port at Jubail proved handy when Dammam and Dhahran\'s
    port and airfield were quickly overwhelmed.

-   The US expanded its bases and especially its naval presence in the
    region with the advent of the War on Terror, and these ports were
    ready to be used for supplying the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq.

-   Naval bases often have intimate relations with nearby ports, and
    regional powers are competing for access to commercial ports in the
    Red Sea, as well as strategic outposts and possible sites of current
    or future naval bases.

-   The competition between naval fleets in the Red Sea and Horn of
    Africa echoes the European competition over footholds in the Gulf a
    century ago.

-   In 1966, the British government issued a white paper on withdrawing
    its military forces from East of Suez. Michael Howard wrote that
    these enclaves were embarrassing liabilities rather than Imperial
    assets.

-   US strategic planners built bases east of Suez to protect needy
    local rulers and protect trade routes around the Arabian Peninsula.

-   The Soviet Union began shipping oil to the Aden refinery for
    production of fuel for its naval vessels in the Indian Ocean and
    Persian Gulf.

-   In the 1970s, Britain leased the island of Diego Garcia to the US,
    who evicted all residents to free the naval base of any local
    pressures.

-   The Cold War competition over bases led to paranoia and pedantry on
    the part of the US military planners, who quantified Soviet naval
    visits to friendly ports and worried that Aden might host Soviet
    naval intelligence and communication facilities.

-   The 1979 overthrow of the Shah of Iran was pivotal for the future of
    US military and naval posture in the region.

-   In response to the revolutionary transformation of Iran, President
    Jimmy Carter devised a new Persian Gulf security framework, the
    Carter Doctrine.

-   The framework called for improving ties with the Gulf states,
    Pakistan and Turkey, and strengthening relations with Somalia and
    Djibouti, and financing regional security needs.

-   A task force established in 1980 formed the kernel of the US Central
    Command, which was officially founded in March 1983. The US built
    bases in the Gulf states and secured pre-positioning and staging
    areas in several locations, including Diego Garcia.

-   Military construction programmes were directed by the US Army Corps
    of Engineers and were a conduit for US business expertise.

-   CENTCOM\'s first operations were to protect hydrocarbon shipping
    during the Tanker Wars. The US signed a number of bilateral military
    agreements with states in the region and opened major bases in
    Kuwait, Oman, and Qatar.

-   The US Navy owns land in Kuwait, Oman, Bahrain, and the Middle East
    for warehousing and logistics, and for refueling and prepositioning,
    and in Djibouti and Diego Garcia for the newly established US Africa
    Command.

-   Jabal Ali, the US Navy\'s busiest port of call, is the perfect
    staging ground for transporting goods from and to Afghanistan.

-   Public unrest against US bases in Bahrain and Saudi Arabia has led
    to the US moving military facilities into the bellies of gigantic
    ports like Jabal Ali or tucked away covertly in far harbours.
    Another way is to move offshore.

-   Major infrastructure projects in Saudi Arabia were interdependent
    with military ventures that built bases, roads, telecommunications
    facilities, and military or naval transport installations. The
    contractors who served them shared knowledge, intelligence, and
    vital equipment.

-   Private firms with Pentagon connections have benefited most from the
    US\'s regular wars in the Middle East, including logistics companies
    based both in the US and the region.

-   Many local firms in the Peninsula and the larger Arab world have
    gone from the shadowlands of obscurity to the sunny uplands of fame
    and fortune by hocking overpriced contracts to the US military. The
    most lavishly rewarded beneficiaries have been the largest firms
    located in Kuwait.

-   Kuwait-based Agility, which secured the second-largest Pentagon
    windfall, illustrates the inextricable ties of commerce and war
    embodied in logistics work.

-   Agility was first established in 1979 as a state-owned firm named
    Public Warehousing Company, and was placed under the management of
    Tarek Sultan, Abdulaziz Sultan\'s son. Its strategy of hiring
    retired US military officers to run its Defense and Government
    Services has proven fruitful.

-   Agility had become the largest logistics firm in the Middle East and
    had been given a 25-year concession to run the state\'s entire
    customs business. It had served as a conduit for an old Kuwaiti
    merchant family to expand beyond Kuwait itself and into the
    lucrative military and government services market.

-   Agility operates in 120 nations and provides logistical expertise,
    warehousing, and retail trade. Its military-logistics division
    provides armed protection for land and maritime transport.

-   US military personnel have a long tradition of circulating between
    government and business, and Erik Prince, the heir to an
    automotive-parts company, formed several private military companies,
    the first of which was the notorious Blackwater. Prince cleaned up
    millions and was invited to the UAE by Mohammed bin Zayed.

-   Prince moved from providing security for transport to furnishing
    logistics and insurance for Chinese mining and energy firms in East
    Africa. His vehicle, Frontier Services Group, is listed in Hong Kong
    and has interests in Pakistan, the Democratic Republic of the Congo,
    Guinea, and South Sudan.

-   The logic of military logistics is the kernel of all these imperial
    ventures. Military airfields become airports, landing sites for
    warships become ports, and detention centers become logistics
    cities, and then military bases can be reconverted into military
    outposts.

-   The business of commercial shipping and maritime transport is
    characterized by unwarranted optimism and the use of algorithmic
    models that predict a sunny future. However, viewed through the
    prism of war and politics, the business is very different.

-   In the time it took to write and revise this book, the face of
    maritime transportation in the Arabian Peninsula has changed. Many
    fast-growing ports have slowed down, and plans for fantastical
    logistical and economic cities have proliferated.

-   War waged by some Peninsula countries hurts their neighbors and
    enemies, but also themselves. In the Red Sea, competition
    intensifies over access to deep water ports and logistics hubs by
    the regional powers.

-   The trajectory of Yemeni ports is dramatically at odds with that of
    other ports in the Arabian Peninsula. The Saudi-UAE coalition\'s
    bombing campaign has destroyed the ports and fragmented Yemen into
    areas controlled by coalition members, their clients, and other
    local actors.

-   Saudi Arabia established a foothold in Mahra province in eastern
    Yemen in December 2017 and has diverted containerized cargo to
    Jeddah or Jabal Ali. Local alliances and enmities have become murky.

-   A Saudi-based marine construction company, Huta Marine, was asked to
    tender for the construction of an oil-export terminal at the Yemeni
    port of Al Ghaydah on the Indian Ocean. The company\'s managing
    director is a German engineer.

-   Al Ghaydah will be built by imperial ambitions of powerful states
    seeking conduits for extracting raw commodities and conveying them
    out to sea. The workers will likely be local labourers desperate for
    employment, and the port will provide Saudi Arabia with another
    outlet for its oil.

-   The economic expansion of Mahra will further integrate this distant
    and culturally autonomous province into Yemen proper, and the buyers
    of the oil may even intervene to protect their interests.

-   Ports bind together cities across the seas to hinterland economies
    and social relations, and in a place like eastern Yemen, where there
    is a long history of transoceanic diasporas, a mechanized port
    modelled on extractive harbors of colonial times may harm these
    social relations.

-   Al Ghaydah\'s fate depends on the people who will build the port,
    work on it, steam from it, and live and die there, in war and peace.
