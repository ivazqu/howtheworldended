# Apartheid and Racial Discrimination
-   All forms of racial discrimination are inherently similar

    -   They have their roots in economic and social structures of
        societies which they serve to consolidate

    -   Apartheid has two semantic variations: one, being more
        propagandistic, i.e, "separate development" through social,
        economic, and political realms. To proceed on different tracks
        while maintaining cultural traditions within different groups;

-   Apartheid stands as a system of discrimination of inequality

-   Apartheid "bestows an artificial unity among non-natives who belong
    to a diverse linguistic and cultural background, while natives are
    divided among many different categories. Division is an attempt for
    preventing national consciousness.

-   Apartheid had not gained national ideology until post-1948, when
    National parties won elections, or displaced entire governments.

-   In South Africa the constitution had recognized Apartheid and placed
    respect upon its ideology.

-   The parliament (principle law-making body) gets empowered by passing
    resolutions and making laws for the purpose of strengthening
    Apartheid. Both prime minister and minister of justice receive
    considerable authority, but they also play a pivotal role in the
    maintenance of apartheid (crushing anti-apartheid groups, and having
    the police under their jurisdiction; specifically the minister of
    justice). "The police force ... has been given very wide powers,
    which it has had no hesitation in exercising. It enjoys the power to
    arrest people on slightest suspicion and to search their possessions
    even without a warrant. It also has the authority to define the
    scope of law in some cases. In this regard mention may be made of
    the Anti-Terrorist Act. Under this act any person who is believed by
    the police to be a terrorist is taken to be one unless he can prove
    the contrary to the satisfaction of the police" (86).

-   Political Parties, National Press, Tech., Universities, and spaces
    of worship all reinforce the system.

-   Loans from European and U.S increase capital
