# (1) The Oil Economy and the Perpetuation of Musical Heritage in Abu Dhabi

-   An essay that analyses culture in Abu Dhabi and the concern over
    losing heritage as rapid change continues

-   UAE established in 1971, prior each of the seven emirates was
    separately governed

-   Abu Dhabi is one of the fastest growing and changing among the
    emirates, as it sits on the largest oil reserves among them

    -   Its development lagged behind Dubai, or other gulf oil producing
        countries

-   Abu Dhabi is a huge international site, which then trickles down
    into the public by having them engage in not only Arab music theory
    but in European instruments as well

-   'Ayyãla, is one of the funūn (an art form) and, is played in
    celebration and amongst a group of men, often seen at weddings,
    holidays, or festivals, but like 'arda and razfa, it was once
    related to battle so that the men can prepare to fight

-   Danielson quotes an Emirati grandmother who believes that women have
    less freedom now than before the advent of oil

    -   Development led to less social exchanges and community

-   Oil was discovered in 1958 in Abu Dhabi and 67' it was producing 1%
    of the worlds oil

-   By 1971, the U.S Foreign Service saw Abu Dhabi as one of the fastest
    changing gulf oil producing countries

-   Abu Dhabi did not have a deep harbour, so they did not engage with
    maritime trade as much as Sharjah, Dubai, or Ras Al-Khaimah

    -   Abu Dhabi engaged in the trade of pearls prior to oil

-   In 1963-64, there was no electricity still , Abu Dhabi was poor (?)

-   By 1980 Abu Dhabi had a skyline

-   "The money economy provided households with cash they were ill
    pre-pared to manage, with some predictably poor results. Further,
    the oil economy was conceptually new compared to what Lienhardt
    observed in the 1950s: 'Until the developments which have come about
    since the exploitation of oil, we do not find a wage-earning economy
    in the shaykhdoms. Income is traditionally distributed not through
    the payment of wages but through profit-sharing, supported by a debt
    system. . . . The social effect of this profit-sharing economy is
    greater ostensible co-operation between the owner of capital and
    capital equipment and those who provide the labour"'(Lienhardt 2001,
    225)." (41)

-   As Abu Dhabi's population consisted mostly of tribal (is that the
    right word, quoting the author?) communities

    -   There is a social and heritage form that comes with this
        community

    -   Oil brough global capital which also brough a more class-based
        competitive society

-   The socioeconomic realties that emerged out of the 60s and 70s came
    from the transition of living throughout the land of Abu Dhabi and
    into new urban centers , especially by the Bedouin

-   The model of change came from the Shaykh (bin Sultan) who brought in
    foreigners as experts in labor, construction, and collaborators for
    Abu Dhabi and the UAE

-   The cultural gap between generations is greater between parents and
    their child, than it is between the parents and their parents

-   Just as quickly the country came into development it also set up
    institutional spaces to preserve heritage, but a majority was to
    preserve the Bedouin societies

    -   In spite of their being a large Persian history/culture

    -   Danielson finds this to be rightly so

-   The preservation of cultural heritage in the UAE became global and
    cosmopolitan

    -   The unification and rapid development led to a need for
        establishing the nations identity and culture

    -   Since there was always an international engagement (maritime
        trade, oil), Bedouin practices are considered cosmopolitan

    -   "More than fostering nationalism, Abu Dhabi and the UAE have
        engaged heritage, including al-ʿayyāla, to advance an ideology
        of cosmopolitanism for the UAE. Al-ʿayyāla, in the governmental
        domain, provides the necessary distinction for the UAE as it
        strives to participate as a player in a global cosmopolitan
        world." (44)

    -   The preservation of the Bedouin is real but also exclusionary
        for the Persian and Indian populations that have been in the UAE
        with their own established institutions
