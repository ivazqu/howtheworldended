# Introduction - Jerome Kohn
- Hannah addresses an audience in 1966 with what has been at the heart of her practice: how can thinking turn into action.
- Arendt believed that observing past successive or unsuccessful efforts, as analogies, would serve as an aversion of present pitfalls; political action is contingent upon its specific circumstance.
- She would use William Faulkner's epigram "This past is not dead, it is not past." Arendt believed that the world we live in is the past. Her belief is not a "lesson" but a question in how past action can be felt/experienced in the present. How are we responsible for the past? This is one of Arendt's last guiding questions.
- Arendt was anti-police in student demonstrations. In 1960, she berated a colleague and long time friend for suggesting that "authorities should be informed" - page X
- The heart of Arendt's view on the cascading immoralities was not due to the ignorance or wickedness of men who could not view the moral truth, but the inadequacy of how moral truths have been standardized in order to judge what men had become. 
- Following Arendt's work is not to follow her theoretical conclusions but to build a space for oneself, in order to think for oneself.
- The Jewish community could not accept the fact that certain Jewish leaders allowed for certain actions to transpire in Nazi Germany. Arendt had lost her credibility as a Jew, it was much easier for those to do wrong, than to suffer wrong. The opposite of the Socratic method. 
- The banality of evil is the thoughtless action.
- Eichmann felt compelled to act, as it was "Kant's will." (failure of philosophical tradition)
- Arendt, in thinking about Kantian question, "with what right and will do I possess the 'concept'?" she begins to break down the word conscience into its greek and latin roots, etymologically, and notes that the negative to positive function of conscience takes shape in Christianity and the discovery of the "will," and that conscience is discovered in its ability to be judged.
- Internal absolute "truths" (from philosophical or meditational contemplation) are what withhold someone from participating in "public affairs" (xxi), as actual political activity depends on collective agreement which departs from those that answer to that which is "higher" than public enactments/laws; like Machiavelli, when moral and religious commandments become public, they corrupt difference
- For Arendt, thinking is self-reflexive, where thinking stops when acting begins, and vice-versa. But the activity of the two, like Kant, determines freedom in the initiation of the activity, not in the activity itself; meaning, that the result of the action is not resolved on its own (autonomously) but in contingency, in relationship to others. Freedom is when something new is brought into the world. 
- Kant's moral duty, for Arendt, is flawed because it showed that someone's "freedom" can be perverse. Kant's freedom was autonomous, a guiding compass derived from universal law of pure practical reason, "pointing out right from wrong" in any given situation to "every rational creature" (xxii). The Kantian individual was self-constituted through self-reflection as they embodied the law through appearance, which is the issue for Arendt, as he could have no consequences for his act. 
- The refusal to judge, invites evil into the world. 
- Jesus is good because he does not know his good, it is hidden from his sight, it destabilizes tomorrow.
