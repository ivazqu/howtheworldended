# The Prize
## *Prologue*

-   In 1911, Winston Churchill (home secretary) was a part of the
    "economist" a British cabinet that was responsible for energy
    development. During that time Churchill did not want to go to war
    with Germany but when Kaiser Wilhelm sent a German vessel into a
    Moroccan harbor, he saw no choice but to go to war with Germany. He
    also sought and saw the benefit of oil consumption within the
    British army

-   August 2, 1990 Saddam Hussein invaded Kuwait (presumably for oil or
    a dismantling of colonial boundaries)

## *Chapter 1, Oil on the Brain: The Beginning*

-   In the mid 19th century a few investors and a chemist saw oil
    "rock oil' as a new competitor against the coal industry,
    specifically in regards to the illumination of lamps (see pages
    19-23)

-   Oil has been a part of military ventures since the Iliad

    -   Oil was mixed with lime -- when water would make contact it
        would catch on fire; known as Greek fire (*oleum incendiarum*)

    -   "In Mesopotamia, back to 3000 B.C.E. The most famous source was
        at Hit, on the Euphrates, not far from Babylon (and the site of
        modern Baghdad)" (p. 23)

        -   Bitumen, often traded in the SWANA region for mortar

-   John D. Rockefeller purchased the Standard Oil Company from his
    partner in 1865 for 72, 500\$.

    -   This company soon became one of the largest multinational corps.
        oil companies in the world

-   By the end of the 1860s Oil Companies stagnated , the supply was
    higher than the demand

-   Trust were formalized and refined during 1882. This came out of a
    bitter oil company wars during the late 1860s, 70s, and early 80s.

    -   It came out of a response from judicial and political attacks
        against the stock holders of the Standard Oil Company.
        Inheritance was on Rockefellers mind, only a trust could clarify
        the debates (litigations, ownership, and values)

-   J.D.R helped establish the U of C

-   Standard committed itself to building the world\'s largest refinery
    at a place called Whiting, amidst desolate sand dunes on the shore
    of Lake Michigan in Indiana, to process the Lima crude

-   Author likes the idea of how one company can control much of the
    economy (guys evil)

## *Chapter 2, "Our Plan": John D. Rockefeller and the Combi-nation of American Oil *

-   Russian oil came to prominence in the late 19^th^ century

    -   See pages 58 through 61

    -   The Nobel family had investments in Oil. Alfred Nobel also
        invested in Oil as well as explosives

-   1869 Suez Canal was completed; by 1870 the telegram had Europe,
    Japan, China, and Australia

-   The two sons of a French merchant trader established and sought
    business in Oil, by the 1890s they had began the production of Oil
    tankers. They sought to cut the tensions of Russian Oil and Standard
    Oil dominance in Europe.

-   By the 1890s, Standard, Rothschild, the Nobels, and other Russians
    had dominated oil production

## *Chapter 3, Competitive Commerce*

-   During the late 19^th^ century is when we begin to see how oil
    companies begin to imagine the globalization of oil. As a private
    industry, they were not bound by the govt. or borders, thus seeing
    the world as an open market was easy to imagine.

-   But competitors arose making expansion difficult, especially as the
    tech. did not meet the difficulties of the topology

-   Standard was a monopoly in the U.S but saw other challengers around
    the globe.

-   1869, Suez Canal was opened.

-   Marcus Samuel wanted to wedge himself into the Kerosene market by
    importing kerosene from the Dutch East Indies into Europe, where at
    the time, Standard oil was dominating.

-   Marcus Samuel was responsible for the Shell company.

-   See this chapter for the rise of the Royal Dutch, Russian Oil,
    Standard, etc.

## *Chapter 4, The New Century*

-   Oil began to supply the new transportation industry, cars.

-   Kerosene was depleting in its need, as the light bulb by the
    beginning of the 20^th^ century was the predominant source for
    light.

-   By 1905, automobiles had become the dominant form for locomotion.

-   Between 1900 and 1912, the production of cars increased 100 fold

-   With increase competition both in the U.S and around the globe,
    Standard no longer became the dominant oil producer

-   Shell had partnered with a Texas oil man, the event is known as
    Spindletop, but Spindletop was hurt by its old forms of drilling,
    and they were unaware that production rates must be controlled by
    maintaining reservoir pressure so that prices could be stable.

-   It was around this time when science became the favored form for
    searching for oil, rather than chance.

-   Shell, Gulf, Sun, and Texaco all formed during this era, the late
    1800s and early 1900s.

## *Chapter 5, The Dragon Slain*

-   The public distrusted the large monopolies being formed through
    trust.

-   Standard oil was buying out senators as the company was being
    challenged for the monopoly in the late 19^th^ century. Even though
    some courts won rulings against Standard, their dissolvements often
    meant reselling interest back to the same people who owned it to
    begin with.

-   In New Jersey, Standard set up their company so that it could own
    stock and interest in their other companies, ultimately still
    controlling and owning the Standard co.

-   Their stock had increased 10 fold after Standard of New Jersey was
    implemented.

-   Ida Tarbell in November 1904 released a book *The History of
    Standard Oil Company*, which told the narrative of how Standard Oil
    became the monopoly that it was known at the time. It was the most
    influential economic/business history book written at the time.

-   That same year, Roosevelt launched an attack against Standard, in
    spite of his reception for big business and trust. In public,
    Roosevelt honored the idea of anti-trust laws. By 1909, the court
    favored the dissolution of Standard.

-   In 1913, cracked gasoline was introduced, see pages 111-112

-   The dissolution only increased Standards stocks.

## *Chapter 6, The Oil Wars: The Rise of Royal Dutch, the Fall of Imperial Russia*

-   Marcus Samuel and his company Shell, pages 114-118

-   Shell and Dutch merge, as the Royal Dutch was facing difficulties
    due to unorganized extraction methods. See pages 122-128

-   Dutch/Shell integrated the Nobels share of oil into their portfolio
    by 1912

## *Chapter 7, "Beer and Skittles" in Persia *

-   Towards the end of the 19^th^ century Persia, specifically Antoine
    Kitabgi Khan, had wanted to collaborate with William Knox D'arcy on
    an oil investment. D'arcy had built his fortune off of mineral
    extractions. (y. 1901)

-   This deal would begin the modern venture of oil within the Middle
    East.

    -   Oil was already very prominent with Persia/Middle East region,
        and could be found in old text and diagrams where it was used as
        a sort of caulk

-   In 1872 and 1889, Baron Julies De Reuters had been approved for
    concessions in oil

    -   Although this generated protest and backlash from both Russia
        and Persia

-   Iran was trying to be controlled and powered by both the Russians
    and British in the middle of 19^th^ century.

    -   Russia was a direct threat to the British colonial role in india
        and their capital, as well as the trade routes between their and
        Europe.

-   The right to the concessions in Persia for the British would allow
    them to balance their power against Russia. D'arcy would open that
    door for them.

-   D'arcy won over the concessions allowing the Shah (Muzzafar al Din)
    to receive about 16 percent of annual net profits

-   Drilling did not commence within the Chiah Surkh mountains (in the
    Iraq-Iran border) until 1902; multiple delays, and equipment failure
    prolonged the project

-   D'arcy began to lose money and was not seeing profits by 1903. By
    then he had applied for a loan thorugh the British Admiralty, by
    influence of Thomas Boverton Redwood (a political figure for oil
    policy before the first world war. Redwood had written a treatise on
    petroleum in 1896, and the process of distillation. He also wanted
    to the British to have control over oil and its operations. The loan
    was denied by the chancellor of exchequer, as he saw that the
    parliament would not approve of such a loan.

-   By 1904, the well had begun to produce oil, and D'arcy was in no
    need of the british resources anymore, although he still looked for
    investors none the less.

-   D'arcy between the years 1903 to 1906 was overdrawn at his bank. The
    bank began to ask for concessions in oil as a return, similarly,
    D'arcy and his oil venture were on the verge of losing control to
    Russia and foreign companies (like the U.S's oil companies or the
    French). The shah in Persia similar saw that Russia was imminently
    on the verge of taking control. The British had sought to gain
    control over the region not in the interest of oil, but in the
    interest of nationality and imperialism.

-   The British had brought in another oil investor into the scheme,
    Burmah Oil became the special investor of D'arcy's operations, which
    would then supply oil to the British navy and Indian markets (y.
    1905).

-   By 1906, the Chiah Surkh had been capped as there was a more
    promising site for oil, Masjid-i-Suleiman. Redwood and Reynolds had
    both decided that-that site was worth more, as the evidence for rich
    oil was abundant.

-   Around this time, the Shah also lost their power to a revolt of
    about 15,000 people.

-   Persia would be divided into two, the British would control the
    south, and Russia would control the North. In 1907, the British and
    Russia reached an agreement through the Anglo-Russian convention.

-   By 1908, Oil had been struck in Persia.

-   By 1909, the Anglo-Persian company had gone public.

-   By 1912, the Anglo-Persian company had signed a trades deal with
    Asiatic to sell gasoline and kerosene, but the rights to its fuel
    oil remained to the Anglo-Persian company, in order for future
    growth.

-   Historical back drop for Iran page 136

## *Chapter 8, The Fateful Plunge*

-   See pages 150 to 156 on Churchill re-building the British Navy off
    of oil. This was also in fear of the Germany Navy and empire
    becoming stronger than the british.

-   By 1912 and 1913, the British fleet had favored oil fuel. What was
    not clear was: who will supply and reap profits from this
    conversion, from coal to oil.

-   The Anglo-Persian oil company was unrelenting in its pursuit to
    build up its capital, it sought to do so through the British
    admiralty. Charles Greenway who directed the company had offered the
    admiralty a 20 year contract in oil fuels.

-   Out of fear of losing influence within Persia from the Germans and
    Russians, the British were after control of oil, land, and commerce.
    Their army was the priority in linking the British relationship
    between colonial activities in Persia and oil.

-   Churchill, in 1913, was responsible for "Oil Fuel Supply for His
    Majesty," which meant securing adequate supplies and oil prices.
    Churchill, along with Charles Greenway, took the role in persuading
    the parliament and the public on oil. Churchill during a
    parliamentary vote had compared oil to the commodities of cotton,
    corn, and other various commodities needed for the countries growth.

-   By mid-1914 the Parliament had passed a vote to buy half of the
    private oil company Anglo-Persian. Unheard of since Disraeli's
    purchase of the Suez prior.

## *Chapter 9, The Blood of Victory: World War I*

-   Pages 167 to 173, World War I

-   The British, during the War, were looking to gain control over the
    Mesopotamian region to ensure their influence and control within
    Kuwait and Persia

-   By 1917, the British had gained control of Baghdad

-   Oil production within the region grew tenfold between 1912 to 1918,
    coinciding with the war

-   TNT war 175

-   Between the year 1916-17, Anglo-Persian had purchased British
    Petroleum from the Deutsche Bank and integrated its oil into BPs
    distribution system

-   Oil Crisis occurred in 1916 due to the German fleet destroying
    transportation and transportation lines

-   1917 a British petroleum policy was put in place. By 1918, as the
    oil crisis ensued France, the United States, and the British created
    an Inter-allied Petroleum Conference

    -   It was also created in response to the U.Ss domestic energy
        problems

-   "In 1914, the United States had produced 266 million barrels-65
    percent of total world output. By 1917, output had risen to 335
    million barrels-67 percent of world output. Exports accounted for a
    quarter of total U.S. production, with the bulk going to Europe. Now
    that access to Russian oil had been closed off by war and
    revolution, the New World had become the oil granary for the Old;
    altogether, the United States was to satisfy 80 percent of the
    Allies\' wartime requirement for petroleum." (178)

-   The U.S created an oil division which worked closely with the
    Natural Petroleum War Service committee

-   "By early 1918, average crude prices were double what they had been
    at the beginning of 1914. Refiners were offering bonuses and
    premiums in order to obtain supplies, while producers were
    withholding supplies on the expectation of still higher prices. This
    situation greatly alarmed the government." (179) -- history repeats
    itself

-   The war and oil, pages 180 -- 183

## *Chapter 10, Opening the Door on the Middle East: The Turkish Petroleum Company*

-   The war made clear that oil is of interest to the countries, and
    that it should be

-   After the War the British were looking for control in, the old
    Turkish/Ottoman empire, Baghdad. The war also proved that there was
    a struggle for controlling resources in the Middle East region -- it
    was the beginning of pitting the British, U.S, and French against
    one another. A turn from have private corps. fight for dominance.

-   Iraq and Iran, decades before the war were already a region of
    competition, after the war a new company emerged the Turkish
    Petroleum company, which was owned partially by Shell, the Deustche
    bank, and the other half was owned by the Turkish Bank, which was a
    bank set up by the British Govt.

    -   In 1914, the British and German govt. worked together to take
        control of the Turkish Petroleum Company, see page (187)

    -   The deal meant that the Germans and British could not be
        involved in oil production in that region, except for the
        British involvement just about everywhere else

-   A concession was drawn up between 1915-1916 for oil in Mosul by the
    French and the British called the Sykes-Picot Agreement. This
    agreement was strained when Mosul was given to the French. In 1917
    the British invaded, and the families and empires that ruled within
    that region for over four centuries were separated or given land
    based on arbitrary drawn lines. The war had made the British anxious
    over their supply, especially since their only source for oil was
    that region.

-   By 1920, the British had secured their position in Mosul, and had
    given the French a 25% cut of all oil produced. Similarly, France
    was given the Germans share of the Turkish Petroleum Company, it was
    not until 1924 that France was able to take the share completely, as
    they were attempting to establish a company through the government,
    in spite of it being private (see 190).

-   France had gained 25% of the share for their private oil company,
    meaning the government had a direct interest in oil beyond its
    effect on the economy through importation

-   Similarly, the British government had sought to gain more than the
    40% stake in the Royal Dutch/Shell company. So the British needed to
    collaborate with the U.S

-   The U.S had feared a shortage of oil in the 1920s, consumption of
    oil increased 90% during the war years, and vehicle registrations
    multiplied 8x. In fear of losing oil the U.S created the "Open Door"
    for acquiring oil, it bought stocks of U.S oil, and sought oil
    outside of the U.S. This was in response to the agreement between
    the British and French, the San Remo Agreement, which created a more
    in depth division in Mesopotamian oil

-   The U.S was advancing its technologies in oil acquisitions, and the
    British started to prefer the U.S inside of their operations and
    schemes rather than as competitors outside.

-   As the U.S attempted to partner with the British, a war was ensuing
    in what was the Turkish-Iraq border, mainly over who owned
    what-land, and what-oil. The British attempting to assert its power
    over the Iraqi, found themselves feuding over what their mandate was
    with the Iraqi, as neither of them could agree on what that meant.
    See the Arab Revolt of the 1916s

-   The British sought the help of Hussein, the Sharif of Mecca, and his
    sons. In exchange the British installed him and his sons as the
    rulers of the new divided nations. Faisal became the king of Syria,
    but was then disposed by the French after the Remo agreement, but
    during the 1920s, Faisal became the King of Iraq in autumn of 1921,
    by the request of Churchill.

-   With the help of London, Faisal would build a parliament and govt.
    suited for the needs of the British.

-   As oil was struck in Iraq, a new deal was made in 1928 between
    multiple companies, the Royal Dutch/Shell, the Anglo-Persian, the
    CPS, and the East Development company (an American syndicate for U.S
    oil companies), this was called the Redline Agreement.

-   Sidenote: Colonialism is often regarded and thought of
    as the antagonist to a country by coming and replacing the people of
    "said" country, but more often than not, and similar to how we
    define neo-colonialism, Colonialism is the use of a classified group
    of individuals against the same classified individuals; similar to
    what has happened all over the middle east and north African region,
    as well as India, Latin America, and the Caribbean, it is the use of
    the land and people against themselves.

## *Chapter 11, From Shortage to Surplus: The Age of Gasoline*

-   The U.S had the worlds smallest car to person ration 5:1 verses the
    British 33:1 by the end of the 1920s. Gas stations had multiplied
    12x across the U.S.

-   Tech. changes allowed for the U.S to develop and find oil faster
    during the 1920s. As the U.S screamed of an oil shortage in the
    1920s, they were finding rich deposits of oil all across the U.S.

-   The new tech. and consolidation/integration of oil companies led to
    more competition for oil, its control and supply, just as much as
    foreign oil was emerging on the world map in the early 20^th^
    century.

    -   Standard was dissolved into smaller companies in 1911, by the
        mid-1920s it became large companies vs. large companies

## *Chapter 12, "The Fight for New Production"*

-   Mexico Eagle is established in 1901, struck oil in 1910. After the
    Mexican revolution, they sell to Royal Dutch/Shell. Mexico's
    development led to a tense relationship between the U.S and Mexico,
    to a near war. A political fight between land disputes and rights
    had ensued during the late 1910s and early 1920s

-   See how Royal Dutch/Shell undermined economies in Latin America in
    this chapter. But more importantly imperial states.

    -   Venezuela was the British largest supplier next to the Persian
        and U.S supply. The U.S also helped to write Venezuelan petro
        laws.

    -   Standard of Indiana purchased Pan American, one of Mexico's
        largest oil companies

-   Soviet Union nationalizes their oil, and Standard of New Jersey buy
    a part of their stock, specifically Nobel's interest, but this
    eventually dissipates. Standard of NY ends up buying Russian petrol.
    All of this was in part of a price war, which led to many of the
    consequences we know of in the international market.

## *Chapter 13, The Flood*

-   There's a huge swath of oil found in east Texas in 1930, "Dad"
    Joiner was overseeing the field with the little money he had

    -   By 1931, the Field was producing 340,000 barrels a day

-   1931 Great Depression has taken the U.S

-   With the great depression and an over production of oil, prices for
    oil had fell. From as high as \$1.85 to ¢15

-   Joiner ends up signing his claims to H.L Hunt on Nov. 27, 1930

-   An overproduction in Texas oil led to a cease in oil production,
    which inevitably rose the price of oil back up, but then
    overproduction continued illegally which drove Texas oil companies
    to slash the prices of oil

-   Roosevelt is inaugurated in 1933, and him and his administration
    wanted to bet against the economy with their "New Deal"

-   With the overproduction and illegal production of oil, Roosevelt
    signed an executive order which regulated the oil economy, but more
    importantly drew lines to how and where oil could be transported.
    This was an attempt to bring the amount of barrels per day down

-   The supreme court ends up overturning these regulations, which
    nearly drew the entire oil industry into collapse, but a voluntary
    system of suggested quotas survives

-   Venezuela was hit the hardest through out these times as 50% of
    their production went to the U.S, but by the mid-1930s Venezuela
    switched to exporting to Europe

-   "Despite its hap hazard growth, the regulatory system as it finally
    evolved did indeed possess a powerful underlying logic. It rewrote
    the book on produc­tion and even, to some degree, on what constituted
    \"ownership\" of oil reserves. It brought a whole new approach to
    production, technically as well as legally and economically." (259)

-   There are two logics to this system: one, the demand for oil was not
    responsive to the movement of prices; two, each state had a natural
    share of the market, if those shares were to, the whole system could
    be disrupted.

## *Chapter 14, "Friends" - and Enemies *

-   During the great depression is when the oil industry began to form
    the industry that we are familiar with today -- the idea
    international oil cartels. Countries and large oil companies fixed
    prices, created quotas, and production levels, but most of this
    ultimately failed, but would continually be developed and used later
    for other ideas.

-   As Anglo-Persian grew John Cadman, the chair, began to realize that
    the two options within the oil market was to either battle in fierce
    competition and investment or establish joint ventures, Cadman chose
    the latter. Anglo-Persian would join the facilities of Shell in
    India in February of 1928.

-   Apart of the joint venture, which the British govt. could only give
    approval to, was an agreement that Anglo-Persian would join Standard
    Oil of New Jersey

-   In 1928, an As-Is agreement was established between multiple
    companies (263). The agreement demarcated markets and production
    quotas for each company. This excluded U.S markets, as it would
    violate anti-trust laws. But this agreement was never really
    successful.

-   During this same period, 17 U.S based companies formed the Export
    Petroleum Association (EPA), which was a joint effort to manage oil
    exports and quotas. Although both the As-Is group and EPA could not
    agree on terms and division between the U.S and European oil
    companies. For much of the 1930s, the As-Is agreement was not
    implemented or enforced and ultimately failed in the U.S and in
    Europe.

-   Shah Reza Pahlavi of Persia was enraged as a spectator of the oil
    economies and markets as he felt that "oil is not god in these
    days." Persia had become an oil state. The royalties from
    Anglo-Persian provided 2/3 of export earning and large sum of govt.
    revenues, but the depression had plummeted revenues. Angered he
    threated that he would cancel the Anglo-Persian concession in 1932.

-   In April of 1933, junder threat of the British govt., Reza Shah
    retreated his efforts in destroying the company and accepted the new
    proposed terms that had been in discussion since 1929. (271)

-   During the 1930s Mexico had attempted to create new agreement
    between Shell and Mexican eagle, specifically for more profits and
    price controls for and within Mexico, as well as proper compensation
    for the workers and unions. Shell could not meet their terms. By
    1938, Mexico had taken over the oil fields, which resulted in the
    Axis powers placing embargoes on Mexico. Diplomatic relationships
    were severed. As the war began, Mexico became the lead supplier for
    oil in Germany and Italy. This placed fears in the eyes of British
    and European oil companies, as Latin America was a key location for
    oil imports into Europe, and especially Britain. (especially
    considering Persia's new position with Anglo-Persian, and the
    growing fears that oil was the primary means for a military)

-   Mexico would eventually have to compensate the companies for their
    expropriation, with the U.S govt. help, they paid American companies
    \$30m, and at the end of the war the paid the British companies
    \$130m

## *Chapter 15, The Arabian Concessions: The World That Frank Holmes Made*

-   Frank Holmes, from New Zealand, formed the Eastern and General
    Syndicate in the 1920s. A company with many business, but with the
    aim and intention of entering the oil market within the middle east.
    He was primarily known for his drugstores, but when he went to
    Bahrain in search of oil he struck a deal with the Sheikh. Holmes
    had found fresh water in Bahrain, and in turn the sheikh allowed him
    oil rights. In 1925 he was given an oil concession. In 1923, he won
    an option for concession in al-Hasa, the eastern part of Saudi, all
    the while trying to establish both concessions and bid for
    concessions in Baghdad. Running short on cash, as Holmes could not
    find the land to properly drill, in 1927 he joined the U.S based
    company Gulf Oil and turned over the rights so that they can work
    together in Arabian concessions. But in 1928, Gulf Oil joined the
    American group in the Turkish Petroleum Company which did not allow
    any one of the companies to operate independently within that
    region. As Gulf could not operate within the region, they worked
    with Socal, where they created a Canadian subsidiary, the Bahrain
    Petroleum Company, to hold the concessions.

-   The problem was that a wall was built in the contracts between the
    multiple split kingdoms and the British. Any oil concessions within
    that area could only operate and be of interest to the British
    empire, but at the time the British govt. was losing its power in
    global politics and was willing to maintain their interest aligned
    with the U.S's. The British allowed for Socal to operate but only
    under the watchful eye of the British. In 1932, the Bahrain
    Petroleum Company hit oil.

-   As Saudi became what it is known today, in 1932, the country was
    losing funds, Ibn Saud looked at water as the potential avenue for
    producing wealth in his country. Under the influence of Jack Philby,
    Ibn Saud was persuaded to allow foreign experts to pervade the land
    for potential water reserves, but within the same year, they came to
    the conclusion that there was no water, but just as oil was struck
    in Bahrain, Ibn Saud gave instructions to find oil reserves.

-   In 1933, Socal signed a deal with Saudi, where \$775,000 was to be
    paid before any oil went into actual production. (291) As the U.S
    based company won the concession, the white house saw no need to
    establish diplomatic representation in Saudi, but in 1939 the U.S
    minister to Egypt was also accredited to Saudi.

-   In Kuwait, the Amir, set off on a dangerous task, to pit the U.S
    against the British in winning over a concession. Kuwait was in need
    of cash, so Sheikh Ahmad brought in American oil companies so that
    he could bolster his position against Britain. Ahmad was angry at
    Britain for he felt as though he was also deserving of the British
    assistance as in Iraq.

-   In 1933, after pitting the Americans against the British, a 50-50
    deal was struck between the two, but the British had to maintain
    their dominance within the region; meaning, the British were to be
    left in charge of operations.

-   "On December 23, 1934, Sheikh Ahmad, having obtained what he wanted,
    affixed his signature to the agreement, which granted a \[75 year\]
    concession to the Kuwait Oil Company. The Sheikh received an up­front
    payment of £35,700-\$179,000. Until oil was found in commercial
    quan­tities, he would receive a minimum of £7,150 (\$36,000) a year.
    Once oil was found, he would receive an annual minimum of £18,800
    (\$94,000), or more-depending on volume." (297-298)

-   In 1933, Two American geologist who had worked on finding oil in
    Bahrain had arrived in Jubail in search of oil. They scoured the
    desert in search of oil, but if it were to be found a problem would
    arise for Socal, the oil company funding the search. So what Socal
    did to mitigate this problem was creating a joint venture with
    Texaco, as they had equipment distributions in the Africa and Asia.
    They would come to be known as Caltex. By March of 1938, oil was
    struck in the Dammam zone.

-   In Kuwait, Oil was struck in February 23, 1938.

-   See pages 300-302 for two key figures in the oil concessions in the
    Arabian region

## *Chapter 16, Japan's Road to War*

-   See this chapter for how oil was a disrupter for Japanese war
    efforts as well as a target.

-   In 1934, the Petroleum Industry Law won passage, which meant that
    the govt. could control imports, quotas, and purchases of oil.

## *Chapter 17, Germany's Formula for War*

-   See this chapter as another example on oil is crucial for war
    strategies, this chapter is specific to Germanies war efforts.

-   Notably, a synthetic oil was formed from coal, but proved to be not
    as useful as oil. German chemist had attempted to create an oil for
    their machines, but ultimately found themselves relying upon Russian
    oil, which they had lost access to.

-   Similarly, in the U.S, Standard of New Jersey had been searching a
    new synthetic oil from coals since the 1920s, but they would
    ultimately set it aside as it was unnecessary, and they did not want
    to create a market in which the Germans had interest in.

## *Chapter 18, Japan's Achilles' Heel*

-   Another chapter on how oil disrupted Japan's war efforts.

## *Chapter 19, The Allies' War*

-   In 1937, Britain had attempted to synthesize an oil from coals like
    the Germans had, just in case they lost their supply of oil from
    bombings.

-   Royal Dutch/Shell was slowly coming under the influence of the Nazi
    regime, stoking a lot of fears for the British. Deterding had become
    old in age and was slowly being seduced by his new younger German
    secretary, and his German colleagues. Deterding had moved to Germany
    in 1939 and had died their that same year. The Germans had attempted
    to gain control of his portion of shell after his death, but to
    little success did they manage.

-   Britain had taken control over Shell, and created a monopoly through
    the Petroleum board, renaming shell to Pool. Britain's oil supply
    was depleting as the war commenced, and they were in need of supply,
    so they turned to the Americans for oil, which the U.S obliged under
    the condition that the British repay the U.S in the future. The
    Lend-Lease was implemented.

-   The U.S oil companies, unlike Britain, needed persuading in trying
    to unite them under one unilateral agreement on oil exports,
    productions, and quotas.

    -   Anti-trust laws were wavered during this period so that
        companies could talk across lines and borders

-   Two major pipelines were assembled in the U.S, Big Inch and Little
    Inch, both made in the respective years 1943 and 1944. Two pipelines
    that spanned 1,254 miles and 1,475 miles. By the end of 1944, 42% of
    all U.S oil was being transported through pipelines. This would
    eventually change how the oil industry would move oil around the
    globe, even during moments of "peace."

    -   The pipeline was made as a war effort

-   Most of this chapter is about how oil was crucial during the war.

## *Chapter 20, The New Center of Gravity*

-   In 1943, the U.S made a special foreign mission to Saudi, to
    appraise the potential for oil in the region. By 1944, DeGolyer who
    ran and oversaw the report came to the conculsion that the region of
    Kuwait, Saudi, Iran, Iraq, Qatar, and Bahrain were the future of oil
    reserves, and at that time they carried more than 1 billion barrels
    as an estimate. During this time the U.S became aware that the world
    would shift the center of oil from the Gulf/Caribbean to the Middle
    east in the future.

-   During this period, the U.S accounted for 90% of oil imports into
    allied countries. In 1940, the U.S produced 63% of the worlds oil,
    while the Middle East produced 5%

-   By 1941, Saudi Arabia was experience another economic downturn due
    to the pilgrimage being halted by war. Ibn Saud sought more
    financial assistance from the British and American oil companies,
    but the white house did not want to intervene. "The British did come
    forward, providing, among other things, about \$2 million worth of
    newly minted coins, and British subsidies would continue to grow
    substantially. But the American oil men worked hard to convince King
    Ibn Saud that this British aid was really American-since Britain, in
    its turn, was a recipient of American assistance. That meant,
    explained the oil men, that the aid actually came from the United
    States. It just came indirectly." (394)

-   Similar to the British by the end of WWI, at the end of WWII the
    U.S, after recognizing a depletion in newly discovered oil fields,
    saw the Middle East as central to oil (especially for times of war).
    Oil was a critical commodity for strategy and national/international
    dominance.

-   The U.S, turning its eyes toward the Middle East and recognizing
    their depletion in oil, had to create a strategy that allowed them
    to secure oil. Two things would occur, the U.S would create a
    Conservation Theory, meaning that they would secure the U.S oil
    reserves by reducing the drain on domestic oil and increase the
    importation of foreign oil. Secondly, the U.S, through the rise of
    oil consumption in the states, would become one of the largest net
    importers for oil; thus, fueling their drive for American security,
    as less domestic oil meant less security, and reserves in the Middle
    East.

-   Socal and Texaco were the only private companies involved in Saudi,
    and they feared like Mexico expropriation, especially as the British
    were loaning Ibn Saud millions of dollars. The country was also
    young, and there was a fear that Ibn Saud would not last as long as
    the oil (which is partially true).

-   Having fears of being kicked out, the American oil companies found
    the argument of involving the U.S govt. easy to make. The Lend-Lease
    agreement was enacted for Saudi Arabia on Feb 18, 1943. "Shortly
    after, the Army Navy Petroleum Board presented its pro­jections for
    1944: A serious shortage of oil was impending, which would threaten
    military operations. The anxieties of the military men gave a
    powerful additional push to the United States government in the
    direction of Saudi Arabia." (397)

-   While the U.S enacted the Lend-Lease agreement, while the Lend-Lease
    agreement was given the white house wanted 100% of the oil
    concession in Saudi (something that would not be possible as other
    private oil companies and Ibn Saud wanted to keep their interest)

-   The U.S and Great Britain were in tense discussion during 1944 on
    who was trying to take whose concession -- after exchanges and
    agreements, the Anglo-American Petroleum Agreement was completed.
    Aug 8, 1944. "The objective was to assure \"equity\" to all parties,
    including the producing countries. The heart of the agreement was
    embodied in the establishmnt e of the eight -member International
    Petroleum Commission. It would prepare estimates for global oil
    demand. It would then allocate suggested production quotas to
    various countries on the basis of such factors as \"available
    reserves, sound engineering practices, relevant economic factors,
    and the interests of producing and consuming countries, and wit h a
    view to the full satisfaction of expanding demand.\" The commission
    would also report to the two governments on how to promote the
    develop ment of the world petroleum industry. The governments, in
    tum, would seek 'to give effect to such approved recommendations
    and, wherever necessary and advisable, to ensure that the activities
    of their nationals will conform thereto.'" (402) This agreement
    eventually died in 1947 as the U.S public would not agree with the
    importation of oil, and like the As-Is agreement it faded away, but
    this agreement was another way to pick up on the conversations that
    occurred during the As-Is talks.

-   See pages 403-405 for Ibn Saud's first trip out of the country since
    his exile in Kuwait.

    -   Roosevelt told Ibn Saud he wanted a Jewish homeland in
        Palestine.

## *Chapter 21, The Postwar Petroleum Order*

-   By 1948 the U.S became dependent on foreign oil. Up until 1947 the
    U.S exported more oil than imported, but that had shifted a year
    later. This shift made the problem of energy security a bigger topic
    amongst oil companies and the U.S govt. at that time.

-   As part of the U.S strategy to secure oil, they had advised and
    helped the two private Socal and Texaco companies (Aramco) secure
    more partnerships with the other American companies Socony and
    Jersey. Ibn Saud also wanted reassurance that the investors and
    concessions would only go towards American companies. He insisted. A
    part of this partnership was dissolvement of the Redline Agreement,
    which meant negotiating with Britain, France, and Gulbenkian.
    Another part of bringing in more profits from the Saudi concession
    was creating more productive and financial avenues for exportations.
    The Saudi reserves were larger than what the American companies
    could handle, and they need an entrance into a market in which
    Jersey and Socony had. Similarly, a new pipeline would have to built
    so that exports could travel to Europe more efficiently, which would
    run through Palestine (the pipeline was called Tapline). What made
    this partnership difficult was the political task of negotiating
    with countries and what would be the establishment of Israel.

-   Aramco would eventually sell of their shares to Socony and Jersey.
    (415)

-   But with the deal "there was still last-minute nervousness.
    Antitrust considerations continued to weigh on the minds of
    executives from all the companies, until they received a reassurance
    from the U.S. Attorney General. 'Off-hand,' the Attorney Gen­eral
    said, he saw 'no legal objections to the deal. It should be a good
    thing for the country.' But then, in confirmation of Harry
    Collier\'s worst fears, political troubles in the eastern
    Mediterranean, which could have an impact on the entire deal, came
    to the fore. There was a communist-led insurrection in Greece and a
    Soviet threat to Turkey, and it was feared that, with Britain
    pulling back from its traditional commitments in the Middle East,
    communist power might grow in the region. On March 11, 1947,
    Socony\'s directors discussed 'the problems affecting the Middle
    East.' But optimism prevailed and they approved the deal. The next
    day, March 12, 1947, officials of the four American companies met
    and signed the documents that put the historic transaction into
    force. The concession in Saudi Arabia had, at last, been
    'solidified.'" (Ibid)

-   March 12, the Truman doctrine was initiated.

-   November 1948, the Redline Agreement was dissolved. Aramco secured
    all of Saudi Arabia's concessions.

-   Kuwait increased their oil production and the Gulf Oil company
    needed an outlet for their production. They partnered with Shell in
    Europe to distribute their oil.

-   During this same period, Jersey and Socony also partnered with
    Anglo-Iranian in their crude oil. A part of the partnership was
    Iran's pressure from the Soviet Union. Stalin was occupying
    Azerbaijan until 1946, and this was the first known confrontation of
    the Cold War. The Iranian Crisis of 1946. Stalin had wanted to
    secure his oil supply.

-   These three deals only guaranteed more oil and energy/security
    crisis in Europe.

-   The U.S would take on European nations economic crisis, as Great
    Britain could no longer sustain other economies. The Marshall Plan
    was enacted on June 1947.

-   Half of European oil imports came from American companies. 20% of
    the Marshall plan would go towards the importation of oil and oil
    equipment. This was so that Europe could change their subsistence
    off of coal to oil. By 1951, 80% of Europe's oil supply came from
    the middle east.

-   By 1948, the As-Is pricing system was gone.

-   During the establishment of Israel, which could have gone south if
    Ibn Saud canceled the oil concession, the Tapline was a contentious
    debate, both Syria and Saudi were arguing for either more money or
    not establishing the state of Israel. Ibn Saud threatened the
    concession but did ultimately back down as Aramco was his biggest
    source of wealth.

    -   "When other Arab countries declared that Saudi Arabia should
        cancel the concession to retaliate against the United States and
        prove its allegiance to the Arab cause, lbn Saud replied that
        oil royalties helped to make Saudi Arabia 'a stronger and more
        powerful nation, better to assist her neighboring Arab states in
        resisting Jewish pretensions.'" (426)

-   So even during the war, the Tapline still proceeded in its
    development, finishing in September 1950. The oil the Tapline
    carried fueled Europe's recovery.

-   By 1950, the U.S saw Saudi Arabia as key territory for U.S security
    and economics, so much so that President Truman wanted to guarantee
    Suadi their own safety.

-   With expanse of offshore drilling and long synthetic fuel lines,
    natural gas was seen as option to imported oil, but it was also
    considered useless and a by-product of oil production. Natural gas
    did ease some of the demand for oil in the U.S.

## *Chapter 22, Fifty-Fifty: The New Deal in Oil*

-   David Ricardo developed the concept that was to provide the
    framework for the battle between nation-states and oil companies
    (Foucault critiqued this very much)

    -   "It was the notion of \"rents\" as something different from
        normal profits. His case study involved grain, but it could also
        apply to oil. Let there be two landlords, said Ricardo, one with
        fields much more fertile than the other. They both sell their
        grain at the same price. But the costs of the one with the more
        fertile fields are much less than those of the one with the less
        fertile fields. The latter makes, perhaps, a profit, but the
        former, the one with the more fertile fields, receives not only
        a profit, but also something much larger-rents. His
        rewards-rents-are derived from the par­ticular qualities of his
        land, which result not from his ingenuity or hard work, but,
        uniquely, from nature\'s bountiful legacy." (432)

-   Rents are the surplus, and at this time, no one knew who get these
    rents.

-   The argument over rents was a political battle, as the oil-producing
    countries saw the struggle over rents as tied to sovereignty, nation
    building, and nationalistic assertions against foreigners as
    exploiters of their countries.

-   Oil producing countries wanted the tax receipts in consuming to
    become income for themselves

-   Venezuelas General Gomez dictatorship came to end in 1935

    -   Generation of '28 emerged and formed as an oppositional left to
        Gomez, they were dispersed in '28 but their party remained --
        Acción Democrática

-   By the late 30s, 90% of Venezuela's economy was based on oil exports

    -   Gomez successors reformed the regulation of the industry --
        contracts between nations and companies and reallocating rents

-   The U.S was behind most of these process, the govt. and companies
    recognized and saw Venezuela's oil reserves as some of the most
    important ones in the world, and by the 1950s Venezuela was the
    U.S's biggest importer, as well as, Standard of New Jersey and Shell
    being the companies operating those reserves

-   Jersey had installed Wallace Pratt in Venezuela to help with
    arrangements, Pratt prior to this was in Mexico where he migrated
    after Mexico's nationalization

-   The agreements that the companies and Venezuela made was a 50-50
    split, which was then passed through their congress in march of 1943

-   In 1945 a coup took place toppling the govt. by young military
    leaders in collaboration with Acción Democrática. Bentancourt was
    the first president. (see David Harvey)

-   After the coup, tax laws were written so that Venezuela could
    actually reap profits from the 50-50 split. Prior to this, critics
    (primarly Pérez Alfonzo) of the new deal saw the agreement as 60-40,
    favoring the companies.

-   By 1948, Venezuela was making 6x more in profits then by 1942

-   Alfonzo "in search of" profits for Venezuela sought the royalties
    that were due for Venezuela, and sold them to the world market.
    Breaking a taboo.

-   In 1948, the Venezuelan govt. was toppled by another coup from the
    same party

-   In 1947, the U.S State Dept. wanted to implement a new policy in the
    Middle East, it wanted to encourage new and more companies so that
    the U.S could secure more oil. In 1947, there was a bid for the
    Kuwaiti Neutral Zone. Which was won by Aminioil for \$7.5m in cash,
    a royalty of \$625k, 15% in profits, and a million dollar yacht for
    the Amir.

-   Saudi's Neutral Zone remained. Jean Paul Getty would send Paul
    Walton to secure a deal in Saudi (1947-1948). Walton and Suleiman
    would eventually work out a deal where Saudi received \$9.5m
    upfront, a million dollars every year even if no oil was found, and
    a royalty of 55¢ a barrel, as well as free oil to the Saudi army.

    -   Suleiman secured the first concession in 1933 with Philby.

-   Saudi and Kuwait held a 50-50 undivided half interest in the Neutral
    Zone, meaning they would split the entire concession

-   "Getty\'s 55-cent-a-barrel royalty to the Saudis loomed over
    Aminoil\'s 35-cent royalty to Kuwait, the roughly 33-cent royalty
    that Aramco had just been com­pelled to pay the Saudis-and far
    overshadowed the 16½ cents that Anglo­Iranian and the Iraq Petroleum
    Company were paying in Iran and Iraq respec­tively, as well as the
    15-cent royalty that the Kuwait Oil Company was paying. The general
    manager of Iraq Petroleum pronounced the 55-cent royalty 'completely
    insane, uncalled for, and responsible for the difficulties being
    encountered in Iran and Iraq.' A British diplomat angrily denounced
    \"the notorious Pacific Western\'\' concession." (444)

-   After Venezuela's 50-50 split, Saudi sought the same deal from other
    companies, the U.S in wanting to maintain good relations in the
    middle east as well as keep the U.S.S.R from intervening suggested
    the 50-50 split to the parent companies as well as the foreign tax
    credit. On December 30, 1950 a new agreement was made based on the
    Venezuelan principles.

    -   For example, in 1949 Aramco would pay \$43m in taxes to the U.S,
        and \$39m in royalties to Saudi, but in 1950 Saudi would receive
        \$110m from Aramco and pay only \$6m to the U.S Treasury

    -   Kuwait would demand a similar deal, and in 1952 so would Iraq

## *Chapter 23, "Old Mossy" and the Struggle for Iran*

-   In 1944 Reza Pahlavi died in exile in South Africa

-   His son, Mohammad Reza Shah Pahlavi, would usurp the throne (1941)

-   Since the 1940s Iran's politics were mired with bribery, hatred
    towards western nations (especially the British), economic strife,
    and oil concessions

-   Towards the end of the 40s Iran economy made the U.S consider that
    it was in threat of Soviet influence. In light of assassinations and
    their attempts the Shah imposed martial law and began campaigns
    asserting his authority.

-   The U.S wanting to maintain their influence sought to give Iran more
    royalties in the Anglo-Iranian concession, at the same time that
    George McGhee was negotiating deals with Saudi.

-   In 1949, the Iranian govt. struck a revised deal with Anglo-Iranian
    on their 1933 concession, but this deal was not submitted to Majlis
    for almost a year after it was already agreed upon. June of 1950

-   The revelation which came a year after led to a furious parliament,
    the assassination of a pro-british politician, the resignation of a
    Prime Minister.

-   As the Korean War set off, the U.S feared a Soviet invasion in Iran,
    especially as the clashed at the border, and Iran accounted for 40%
    of the Middle East's oil production at the time.

-   The U.S had pressured the British to give a new supplemental deal to
    Iran to ease tensions within the country as well as the concession,
    but as the 50-50 deal emerged out of Saudi, the supplemental deal
    was taken off the tables. The Majlis were unhappy with the
    concession and wanted it to be nationalized. In March of 1951, the
    Prime Minister Razmara was assassinated, shortly after giving a
    speech on not nationalizing the concession. A week and a half later,
    the Prime Minister of education was also assassinated. The Maljis
    proceeded to nationalize their oil industry (through Mossadegh) in
    May 1, 1951.

-   The British were ready to invade Iran to secure its oil concession,
    but the U.S pushed against such an idea as it would allow for ease
    of access in the north for the U.S.S.R

-   A copy of Alice in Wonderland was ordered from Washington as a guide
    for what lies ahead ???

-   The expropriation of the oil fields led to an economic warfare with
    the British, embargoes and a seizure of finance and trade facilities
    that were available to Iran

-   The British were prepared to invade, but could not come to those
    terms as their position as an imperial power was weaking

-   The U.S enacted the Defense Production Act of 1950 and with 19 oil
    companies coordinated and pooled oil supplies and facilities. The
    threat of losing Iran's oil meant that by the end of 1951 the
    world's demand for oil would exceed its supply.

-   By 1952, the world had increased its oil output by 2 million
    barrels, without Iran.

    -   From 10.9m in 1950, to 13m in 1952.

-   \[see Wiki
    <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mohammad_Mosaddegh#Overthrow_of_Mosaddegh>
    \]

-   In April of 1953, the U.S approved of a CIA mission to overthrow
    Mossadegh. A \$1m plan.

-   In July 1953, the U.S and the British agreed to work cooperatively
    \[although it was likely well before\]

-   The U.S wanted the Shah to not declare Mossadegh's power, but he was
    too afraid as the Soviets were getting close to influence

-   General Fazlolla Zahedi, one of the Shah's men, would be used in
    Operation Ajax.

    -   The CIA would back support for Mossadegh, and those supporters
        would act in tyrannical manners making Mossadegh seem for like a
        dictator. It was a propaganda campaign to make Mossadegh look
        undemocratic

    -   Zahedi held a press conference in which he handed out photostats
        of the Shah's orders dismissing Mossadegh. A small pro-shah
        demonstration grew, also CIA back , which then turned into a
        chaos and a pro-shah military force to oust Mossadegh and send
        him to prison

-   By the end of 1953, the Shah had been put back into power.

-   The U.S and British would take back their stakes in Iranian oil
    through a camouflage of multiple companies, mostly American oil
    companies.

-   As the U.S invited companies to enter into a consortium with Iran,
    they also were bringing an anti-trust lawsuit against them

-   The anti-trust lawsuit brought the term Petroleum Cartel into public
    discourse as the U.S subpoenaed company documents which had revealed
    an extensive and precise history of the oil industry. The papers
    were released in 1952, but were completed in 1949.

    -   Part of the oil industry being labeled as a cartel was Harold
        Ickes initiative to help broaden and expand American oil
        companies in the 30s as well as during the war -- the
        consortiums that were built than. And Harold Ickes was apart of
        the White House.

-   The White House ultimately dropped the lawsuit. And in 1954
    Eisenhower guaranteed oil companies that business abroad would not
    violate antitrust laws.

-   The new deal for oil in Iran was difficult as the Shah needed to
    maintain the perspective that he was not a puppet.

-   "The establishment of the consortium marked one of the great turning
    points for the oil industry. The concept of the concession owned by
    foreigners was for the first time replaced by negotiation and mutual
    agreement. The Mexican experience had been a dictated expropriation.
    But now, in Iran, all parties ac­knowledged, again for the first
    time, that the oil assets belonged, in principle, to Iran. Under
    this new deal, Iran\'s National Iranian Oil Company would own the
    country\'s oil resources and facilities. But, in practice, it could
    not tell the consortium what to do. The consortium would, as a
    contract agent, manage the Iranian industry and buy all the output,
    with each company in the consortium disposing of its share of the
    oil through its own independent marketing system." (476)

-   This new consortium made the U.S the biggest influence in Middle
    East oil politics.

-   Biggest the U.S could not attack the big oil consortiums, they had
    to move down the latter to marketing and distribution companies such
    as the Far East company or Caltex. By 1968, the pursuit for the
    antitrust actions was closed.

-   Anglo-Iranian ended up being paid \$90m for 60% of the rights for
    the company they were giving up, and an additional 55¢ for per
    barrel till \$500m was paid by the consortium.

## *Chapter 24, The Suez Crisis*

-   The Suez canal construction began in 1859 and was completed by 1869,
    Ferdinand de Lesseps oversaw the operation.

-   The British and French took ownership over the Suez canal in 1857 --
    as the Khedive fell into insolvency

-   The Suez canal became fundamental in military position by the
    British, especially for protection of India, their security
    strategies, and especially during WWII

-   By 1948 India became independent -- the Suez canal was not seen as a
    protector of India

-   By 1955 oil was the biggest commerce flowing through the canal. 2/3
    of the traffic on the canal was oil. The Suez canal became an
    important marker for the oil industry

-   G.B had held a military occupation in Egypt for approximately 75
    years. During the post-war era Egypt (like many other countries) had
    grown a strong sense of nationalism and decolonialism. By 1952 a
    coup had erected King Farouk, and by 1954 Nasser had erected the
    coup that took over in 52'

-   Nasser proliferated Arab identity across the region (radio, news,
    etc)

-   Most of the toll profits went to G.B

    -   Nasser wanted to reform that

-   In attempting to bring more profits to Egypt, the U.S, G.B, and
    World Bank were preparing a loan for Egypt that would be for a dam
    on the Nile, which would bring profits into Egypt. This was canceled
    as Nasser was looking for an arms deal with the USSR (483)

-   On July 26, 1956, Nasser took control of the Suez canal with the
    military. This was after the U.S, the World Bank, and the British
    gave a loan to Yugoslavia instead of Nasser.

-   The U.S would back away from the British and French interest of
    military intervention (mostly because Eisenhower was up for
    reelection).

-   Britain during this only had enough gold and dollar reserves to
    cover only three months of imports

-   The U.S and Western Europe needed an alternative to the suez canal,
    especially as reserves could run up and demand the reserves of the
    U.S and Venezuela

-   A Texas oil man tried to lie and warn King Saud that the U.S found a
    new source of energy that would run the Middle East and his business
    dry, that was Nuclear energy

-   "On October 24, 1956, senior British and French diplomatic and
    military officials, including the respective foreign ministers, met
    secretly at a villa in Sevres, outside Paris, with a delegation of
    top Israelis, including David Ben-Gurion, Moshe Dayan, and Shimon
    Peres. The three nations came to an understanding: Israel,
    responding to Egyptian threats and military pressure, would launch a
    military strike across the virtually uninhabited Sinai Peninsula
    toward the Suez Canal. Britain and France would issue an ultimatum
    about protecting the canal, and then, if the fighting continued - as
    surely it would - they would invade the Canal Zone to protect the
    international waterway. The ultimate objective for the British and
    French would be to effect a canal settlement and, if possible, to
    topple Nasser in the process." (489)

-   The British and the French teamed up only so that they could prevent
    each other from going to war in Jordan.

-   On October 29 Israel launched an attack into the Sinai

-   Oct. 31, Britain bombed Egypt's air fields, forcing the Egyptian
    army to retreat across the Sinai

-   In Nov. Nasser had blocked the canal with ships filled with cement
    and rocks, as well as sabotaging the pumping stations along the Iraq
    Petro. Company pipeline, which along with the ships further reduced
    supplies

-   The French and the British had assumed that the U.S would step in to
    help them secure some of their own supplies, but Eisenhower in a
    heat of rage decided that they should boil in their own oil, and
    imposed sanctions on both countries

-   By Nov. 5, Israel had taken control of the Sinai, the Gaza Strip,
    and the Strait of Tiran

-   By Nov. 6, the British and French agreed to a cease-fire, but
    Washington wanted a more, a full withdrawal of troops and the
    Israeli's, if not the U.S would impose oil sanctions on both Britain
    and France.

-   By Nov. 7, the British govt. announced a 10 percent cut in
    consumption

-   The IMF refused the British financial aid as the pound was declining
    in value

-   By the end of Nov. the British and French pledged a withdrawal

-   By December, with the Suez canal nationalized, Europe needed another
    way to get their oil. So they resorted to Oil Tankers which would
    travel around the cape of good hope.

    -   Japanese tankers would prove useful

-   The OECD created a Petroleum Emergency Group which made allocations
    based on pre-Suez oil use

-   Much of Western Europe had to cope with their new rationing energy
    consumption through various measure; for example, Britain increased
    prices and new taxes, hiking up oil prices and taxi fares

-   Price increases led to congressional hearings in the U.S and new
    antitrust prosecutions of 29 oil companies, but by 1960 the case was
    tossed

-   By 1957, the oil crisis came to an end

-   By March of 57' Egypt had full control of the Suez Canal

-   Prime Minister Eden compared the times of the Suez Canal crisis as
    similar to 1936

## *Chapter 25, The Elephants*

-   A giant oil field is called an elephant

-   The 50s and 60s was a rapid growth of oil consumption, and it was an
    era where the supplies of oil had grew even more

-   In 1942 the productions level were 8.7millions barrels, by 1972 they
    were approx. 42 million barrels a day

-   Americas world production share had fallen from 64% to 22%

-   The Middle East had seen an increase of 1500% in their production

-   "By 1972, after all the years of rapid growth, of the intoxicating
    increase in consumption and the pell­mell pace of production, the
    estimated reserve life was thirty-five years." (500)

-   Price cuts became the most potent weapon, as they proved to be a
    valuable tactic to oil-producing countries, especially within the
    context of nationalism. Nasser's control of the Suez sparked this
    tactic.

-   There are two foundations for the postwar petroleum order

    -   One, the oil deals of the 1940s established the basic
        relationships of companies operating within the Middle East. The
        arrangements made during that period was to make the resources
        match the pace for the expanding petroleum reserves; the
        production was connected with the refining and the marketing
        systems, and the demand was developed and secured.

    -   Two, concessions and contracts were based on a 50-50 profit
        sharing arrangement

-   The Shah of Iran (during the 1950s) pursued a different approach to
    the oil concessions that dominated the middle eastern region since
    the 1930s. The Shah would seek the assistance of Enrico Mattei, who
    managed AGIP, Italie's state owned oil company. AGIP was gathered
    into ENI.

-   In 1954 Anglo-Iranian took of the subsidiary name BP.

-   Mattei went to Iran looking for their concession after it had been
    nationalized -- the resources were nationalized but the reserves
    were not (they were owned by foreign companies).

-   ENI would receive 25% of the profit, Iran would receive the rest
    (1957)

-   The White House protested this split as they felt it would
    jeopardize Europe's oil supply

-   The Suez crisis prompted Japan to want to secure their supplies. In
    1957 Japan, specifically Arabian Oil Company (led by Taro
    Yamashita), began discussing a concession with Saudi off-shore, off
    the border of the Neutral zone. Japan could not give a large down
    payment which Saudi had asked for, so instead an agreement came up
    that Japan would lower their share from profits. Saudi would 57% of
    the cut. Kuwait shortly after followed. By 1960, Oil was discovered.

-   Standard of Indiana, in a similar vain to ENI, would sign an
    offshore concession with Iran. 75-25 split.

-   The coup in Iraq in 1958 (which removed the British installed royal
    family on the throne) set off a fear that Nasser's ideas would take
    a stronghold across the Middle East. Oil had begun to pass through
    the Suez under the Nasser's control.

-   "At a conclave of Arab Oil Experts in Egypt, in the spring of 1957,
    the delegates proposed the building up of domestic refining capacity
    and the establishment of an Arab tanker fleet and an Arab pipeline
    to the Mediterranean. They also discussed creating an Arab
    'international body' or 'international consortium' that would manage
    Middle Eastern oil production, increase revenues, and counterbalance
    the power of the petroleum companies. The group emphasized the need
    to build up Arab ex­pertise and technical skills in order to
    challenge their mystique" (509).

-   The idea of creating a consortium of oil-producing (arab) countries
    would need the participation of Venezuala. A world leading exporter.
    Venezuela had interest in the consortium as the price of their oil
    was costly to produce, about ¢80 per barrel vs ¢20 per barrel in
    Iran.

-   1950s world oil was increasing, exporting countries sought to gain
    revenue by the volume of oil sold rather than raising the price

-   Price discounts were being offered at the time as surplus was needed
    to enter into a "less-than-global" market. The U.S had also
    instilled new quotas which had disrupted both the Venezuelan market
    and the Middle East.

-   It was also between 1955 and 1960 the Soviet Union's oil out
    doubled, and they had surpassed the U.S as being the second largest
    oil producer in the world. Approx. 1/3 the output of what the Middle
    East was producing -- This also fueled the idea of having to

-   The first Arab Oil Congress was held in April of 1959 -- Venezuela
    also attended.

-   The European and U.S based companies saw the conference as a success
    and that it would bolster relationships between the Arab world and
    MNOCs.

-   During the conference, set up through a Wanda Jablonski (a notorious
    reporter), representatives of Saudi, Venezuela, Iran, and Iraq met
    to create a gentleman's agreement to establish an Oil Consulative
    Commision and also defend the price structures of oil. This meant
    removing the 50-50 principle and move towards a 60-40 split. "In
    addition, they should build up their domestic refining capacity,
    move down­stream, and become more integrated in order to \"assure
    stable markets\" for themselves, and thus better protect government
    revenues." (518)

## *Chapter 26, OPEC and the Surge Pot*

-   Surplus of oil persisted

-   The Soviet Union began to aggressively market their oil, slash their
    prices and make deals in order to drive their sales within the
    "West"

-   Their goal was to create dependency on Russian oil within Western
    Europe and weaken the unity of NATO, and subvert the U.S and Western
    Europe's oil position in the Middle East

-   The U.S.S.R was in need of dollars and other currencies in order to
    buy industrial materials and agricultural products. Oil exports were
    one of the few things they could sell, even as it is today. At a
    certain point Russian oil could be bought have the price that it was
    being sold from the Middle East

-   One of the largest consumers of Russian oil was ENI, Italy's oil
    company

-   Price cuts were needed in order to compete with Russian oil, but the
    first price cut in 1959, which led to the Gentlemen's Agreement, had
    hurt the Arab oil congress as they absorbed the risk.

-   In 1960, the Standard of New Jersey announced a price cut of about
    7% (¢14 cents a barrel) -- a few other companies followed suit, but
    many people disagreed with the cut as it would severely weaken the
    oil producing countries revenue

-   In Sep. 6, 1960 , Shell had raised the prices by ¢4 to ¢6 in order
    to ease tentions with oil producing countries, but it was to no
    avail. By Sep. 10, Saudi, Ven., Kuwait, Iraq, Iran, and Qatar (as a
    spector) met in Baghdad to discuss a new oil formation. By Sep. 14,
    OPEC had been formed. The five founding members of OPEC were at the
    time 80% of the worlds oil exporters. OPEC had to be consulted by
    foreign companies before adjusting any price, production, or output.
    It was an organization meant to control the revenues internal to
    their countries.

-   In Nov. 1960, the CIA had dedicated only four lines to this new
    formation, the world was not recognizing the legitimacy of OPEC

-   In spite of their formation in the 60s, OPEC did not have much of a
    say in their production as the oil reserves beneath the ground were
    owned externally. But the 60s was an era of decolonization globally.

-   In 1961, Kuwait became independent of Britain. (Iraq tried to claim
    Kuwait, Britain sent troops, and Iraq temporarily left OPEC as a
    protest)

-   In 1962 Abdullah Tariki was fired from his position as the oil
    minister and replaced by Ahmed Zaki Yamani (who had no aspiration
    for a Texas Railroad Commission)

-   Months after WWII Charles De Gaule ordered that France find their
    own oil supply, as he claimed that France could not depend on other
    countries for oil

    -   CFP was occupied with the Iraq Petroleum company and their
        position in the middle east

    -   France formed a new group of state companies called BRP to
        explore oil outside of France. After seven years oil was
        discovered in West Africa, Gabon.

    -   The Suez crisis had urged the need for oil that France "owned"

    -   In 56', Oil was discovered in Algeria. By 58', oil was being
        exported to France.

    -   The Algerian war began in 54', which made exporting oil
        difficult. It was rumored that G.B and Italy were colluding with
        the opposition in Algiers to gain a concession there

    -   Despite this, by 61' French owned and controlled oil companies
        in Algiers and France were producing 94% of France's demand for
        oil

    -   By 62', Algeria had won its independence, but the agreement that
        de Gaulle negotiated would retain France's position in Saharan
        oil.

    -   By 65', France had formed a large oil company with other merged
        smaller companies called Elf-ERAP

-   A joint venture between BP-Shell in Nigeria (starting back in 1937)
    struck oil in 56' along the Niger river.

-   During the 1950s it was loomed that oil was in Libya, as a lure,
    Libya had created a petroleum law which would allow concessions for
    a number of independent companies which did not have oil concessions
    and productions to protect, and that Libya's share of profit would
    be determined by the actual market price of oil. By 57', seventeen
    companies had bid for a concession. By 61', Standard of New Jersey
    struck oil at Zelten. By 1965, Libya was the 6^th^ largest oil
    exporter in the world. By 1969, its output had exceeded Saudi, and
    they producing over 3 million barrels a day.

-   Between 1960-69, exports became a fierce competition globally. Libya
    tried to sell their oil at whatever cost (the independents in
    Libya). Oil prices had fallen ¢36 a barrel, a drop of 40%. Oil was
    in abundance.

-   The post WWII order of oil was different / changing to what had
    always been, prior to the war oil was a market of competition that
    could enter and break into the established order, after the war
    there were too many players in the game which made entrance more
    complicated. In 1946 there were 9 oil companies in the middle east,
    by 1956 there were 19, by 1970 there were 81 companies. Between 1953
    to 1972 more 350 companies had entered the foreign oil industry or
    expanded their participation. "In 1953, no private oil company
    anywhere in the world, other than the seven largest, had as much as
    200 million barrels of proven foreign reserves; by 1972, at least
    thirteen of the 'new internationals' each owned more than 2 billion
    barrels of foreign reserves. Altogether, the new entrants owned 112
    billion barrels of proven reserves-a quarter of the free world
    total. By 1972, the 'new internationals' had a total daily output
    among them of 5.2 million barrels per day" (532). Post 57', oil
    profit returns was declining, with the amount of new players coming
    in and the surplus of oil, the high rate of return pre-WW2 was
    dwindling.

    -   Crisis like Mossadegh, the Korean War, and Suez kept the profit
        rate above 20% but after the Suez opened, the markets were
        flooded.

-   There was a need to balance supply and demand between Saudi and
    Iran, a rivalry was built between the two nations. Both had large
    amounts of reserves, and both leaders saw more output as more
    wealth, which meant more power. The Persian gulf became the
    stabilizer in controlling supply and demand.

-   Coordinating a deal with Iran and Saudi during the 50s and 60s was
    more political than economic. The cost difference between the two
    was "pennies." The Shah of Iran had a disdain towards Saudi as he
    tried to put Iran in the number one seat for oil growth in the
    Middle East. The shah would pressure U.S officials into pressuring
    their companies into favoring Iran's oil. He promised of work
    against Nasser and that the U.S's relationship with Iran was coming
    to an end if Iran would not receive the demands that it wanted from
    companies. He went as far as establishing relationships with Russia
    and threatening to reorient imports to the U.S.S.R. Ultimately, both
    the British and U.S would favor and do their best to meet Iran's
    demands over Saudi. Between 57-70 Iran's production grew more than
    Saudi's, 387% to Saudi's 258%. But Saudi had a larger oil reserve,
    respectively the difference was only about 5%. A large portion of
    this is due to Iraq revoking 99.5% of their concession in the early
    1960s.

-   Much of the globe welcomed imported oil, except for the U.S (during
    the 50s) where independent oil producers pressured the state in
    trying to restrict or implement quotas on foreign oil. The Suez
    crisis raised concerns about national security, the fall of prices
    increased the necessity for protection in the form of tariffs or
    quotas. Eisenhower's administration was against tariffs and quotas
    and were pushing for more free trade, so instead of raising tariffs
    and quotas, the admin. had tried to resort to stockpiling their
    storage with domestic oil. This was denied. What was mounting in the
    background was senators, either oil business men or were sponsored
    by them, who were looking to implement quotas in order to raise the
    prices on domestic oil. National security was a misleading
    presentation of what was actually going on. Eisenhower in the end
    ultimately had to implement quotas as senators were preparing to
    take action into their own hands. On March 10, 1959 Eisenhower
    imposed mandatory quotas on imported oil (Mandatory Oil Import
    Program). The quotas lasted 14 years, till 1973. The imported oil
    could not exceed more than 9% of total domestic consumption. Kennedy
    tightened the quotas more in 62'. During the war the Johnson admin.
    tried to reduce the quotas in order to bring down inflation due to
    the Vietnam war, but they ultimately remained intact.

-   "By the time of the Johnson Administration, one official was calling
    the entire quotas program \"an administrative nightmare.\" It also
    had far-reaching effects. It led, as was intended, to higher levels
    of investment in domestic oil exploration, relative to exploration
    outside the United States, than would have otherwise been the case.
    It tilted foreign investment by U.S. companies toward Canada, on
    account of that country\'s preferential access to the American
    market. It resulted in the building of substantial refining capacity
    in the American Virgin Islands and Puerto Rico because of special
    exemptions to the quotas that were granted to refineries there on
    economic development grounds. And, finally, the program gave an
    important impetus to the global oil trade. If companies could not
    bring foreign oil into their own systems in the United States, which
    was the objective of integration, then they would have to find and
    develop markets elsewhere in the world." (539).

-   Prices of oil in the U.S were higher but also became stabilized.
    Between 59'-68' oil was \$2.90 a barrel to then \$2.94 -- it was
    also 60% higher than middle eastern oil. The program allowed for
    domestic oil prices to be protected against foreign oil.
    International oil companies had to reorient their agendas to also
    satisfy U.S domestic output.

## *Chapter 27, Hydrocarbon Man*

-   Global consumption tripled between 1949 to 1972. In the U.S oil
    consumption tripled between 5.8 to 16.4 million barrels per day. In
    Western Europe oil increased 15x from 970,000 to 14.1 million
    barrels per day. In Japan it had increased from 32,000 to 4.4
    million barrels per day. Rapid economic growth which led to rising
    incomes led to the growing consumption. Just as much as oil
    increased so did the purchase of vehicles.

-   The petrochemical industry helped to produce and create more
    plastics.

-   During the 50s and 60s oil prices fell, and exporting countries
    wanted more of their volumes sold in order to gain higher revenues.
    Threats were made in order to meet the demands.

-   Growth and production could not have been met without new
    infrastructure.

    -   Tankers multiplied and new supertankers formed

-   The necessity of coal declined post-ww2 with the decrease of prices
    in oil

    -   Coal prices were not decreasing but oil was

-   With the shortfall of coal in Europe, countries had to shift their
    dependence onto oil for energy security. In Britain, after Suez,
    they pushed for their first nuclear program for energy dependence --
    as the assurance of oil was questioned.

-   In the mid 50s coal accounted for about 70% of Europe's energy use,
    and oil about 23%, by 1972, it had completely reversed

-   Japan experienced a more rapid shift during the 60s after U.S
    occupation in the 40s.

-   Germany and Japan experienced high economic growth during the 60s
    and 70s as their economies became reliant upon institutional
    arrangements and cheap oil.

-   Supply was having a tough time finding the demand in Europe 546-548

-   Oil companies invested heavily into advertisement to drive up
    consumption, not only in oil but adjacent industries in which oil
    was a part of or an investor in

-   The rise of the automotive industry paved the way to suburbanization

    -   Single family houses rose from 114,000 in 1944 to 1.7 million in
        1950

    -   From 1945 to 1954, 9 million people moved to the suburbs. The
        number of people living in cities shifted to 10 millions added
        compared to the suburbs added 85 million

    -   Suburbs made the car a necessity

    -   New highways began to pop up across the U.S throughout the 50s
        and 60s

    -   "in 1956, President Dwight D. Eisenhower signed the Interstate
        Highway Bill, which provided for a 41,000-mile superhighway
        system (later raised to 42,500 miles) that would crisscross the
        nation. The Federal government would pay 90 percent of the cost,
        with most of the money coming from a specially designated,
        non­divertible highway trust fund accumulated out of gasoline
        taxes" (553).

-   The six day war commenced in 67' (June 5, 67'), Israel had pushed
    Egypt out of the Sinai and had gained control of the Golan Heights,
    West Bank, Sinai, and all of Jerusalem.

    -   On June 6, the exporting countries imposed an embargo on
        countries friendly to Israel. Shipments were banned to the U.S,
        Britain, and West Germany

    -   Why 67 embargo? The decision was partly based on disruptions
        inside of exporting countries, riots, mobs, protest, etc.

    -   By June 8, the flow of oil was reduced by 60%. Iran's refineries
        were closed as Iraqi ships were not transporting their oil.

        -   Western Europe was on the verge of experiencing an energy
            crisis as 2/3 of the consumption was now reliant upon oil

    -   A Nigerian Civil War in June also caused conflict in global
        exported oil.

        -   They wanted more revenues

    -   An Ex-Com committee was formed under Johnson, its aim was to
        activate the Foreign Petrolem Supply Committee, so as to jointly
        manage logistics and oil lifts to Europe by several American oil
        companies, once used during the Iranian nationalization crisis
        of 51-53, and the Suez Crisis in 56-57. It was under the
        assumption the OECD would allow for western countries to
        reorganize the flow of oil , but OECD did not allow for that to
        happen as the felt they could handle it themselves

        -   This meant that tankers were needed to go around the cape of
            good hope

        -   Tankers 5x larger than the ones in 56' were available by 67'

    -   One month after the embargo, it was considered a failure as
        supplies were being redistributed elsewhere. America had the
        reserves to fill in the gap, Venezuela stepped up production, as
        did Iran.

    -   By Sept. the embargo was lifted as the countries that
        implemented were seeing revenue deplete with no consequences

    -   The total output of Arab oil was 8% higher by the end of the
        selective embargo than before. They had to make up for their
        loss.

    -   U.S learned that it needed to maintain a large tanker fleet and
        a diverse source of supplies to make up for any potential losses

    -   Shortage was not the fear during this time, it was oversupply

## *Chapter 28, The Hinge Years: Countries Versus Companies*

-   Both Britain and the U.S were in a political recession in the 60s,
    anti-war movements, decolonization, anti-neocolonial rhetoric, and
    anti-imperialism was on the rise

-   The U.S was a newcomer to the Middle East as opposed to the G.B who
    had been present since the 1800s. G.B was involved in the area
    through its ventures in India and maritime trade and war. G.B had
    established truces through states which it then sought to establish
    occupations (?)

    -   Bahrain, Kuwait, Dubai, and Qatar were areas the British would
        have a foothold

    -   Towards the 60s the British were occupied with their countries
        liquidation and its occupation of the port Aden

    -   In 1968 PM Harold Wilson declared the British defense
        commitments east of the Suez. Aden had fallen into the hands of
        Yemen

    -   By 1971, the British eliminated their last major remanent of the
        great Pax Britannica of the 19^th^ century Raj

-   The British had helped set up the UAE

-   The Nixon administration had approved of Iran filling in the British
    void in the middle east. Nixon and the Shah had a working
    relationship since 53'.

-   The 70s there was a shift in oil. Demand was reaching the supply,
    and the 20 year surplus had come to an end.

-   The late 60s and 70s was era of high economic growth, which meant
    the world was becoming more dependent on the Middle East and North
    Africa. Demand rose from 19 million barrels per day in 1960 to 44
    million barrels per day in 1972.

-   "For decades, going back to Dad Joiner, the East Texas field, and
    Harold Ickes, production had been regulated by the Texas Railroad
    Commission, the Oklahoma Cor­porations Commission, the Louisiana
    Conservation Commission, and similar bodies in other states. They
    had prorationed output, keeping actual production well below
    capacity in order to promote conservation, and maintained prices in
    a situation of chronic potential oversupply. The inadvertent result
    of their work had been to provide the United States and the entire
    Western world with a security reserve, a surge capacity, that could
    be called upon in time of crisis" (567).

-   The U.S between 57' to 63' was producing about 4 million barrels per
    day in surplus, by 1970 they were only producing 1m.

    -   Overall production was about 11.3m per day

-   In march 71', the Texas Railroad Commission allowed for a 100%
    production output; similarly, the U.S had eased its quotas from the
    Eisenhower admin. In 1967 there 2.2 mbpd, by 73' it was 6mbpd.
    Imports as a share of total oil consumption had risen from 19% to
    36%.

-   In Nov. 1968, the U.S warned at an OECD meeting that their
    production was about to hit capacity and that the U.S could no
    longer be relied upon for their oil in an emergency

-   65' a NY mayor pledged to remove coal from NY. In 66' the city was
    plagued with smog, and by 67' a clean air bill passed the U.S
    Senate. In 70', Federal Legislation enacted the environmental impact
    statements; meaning, the possible consequences for the environment
    of a major project had to be projected before it could be approved.
    The same year 100k people paraded through NY to celebrate earth day.
    Utilities in the U.S and primarily around the globe switched to oil.

-   *The Limits to Growth: A Report for the Club of Rome\'s Project on
    \"The Predicament of Mankind.* \" Published in 1972 warned off the
    decline of humanity within the next 100 years

-   The impact of environmentalism grew, and oil was favored over coal

-   Oil was struck in Alaska, but environmentalist had prolonged its
    development and had brought it to a halt

-   67' War made Libyan oil more valuable

-   Armand Hammer, and his company Occidental Petroleum won a concession
    and struck oil in Libya in 62' by 64' they were exporting oil
    through a major pipeline constructed about 130 miles long. Hammer
    felt as though politically Libya could shift dramatically and he
    need to another form of assurance so he invested in Island Creek
    Coal at the expense of terrible advice (that the Kings passing would
    be a smooth transition).

-   Qaddafi had successfully overthrown the old regime of King Iris.
    This was planned a decade earlier.

-   By 69', when Qaddafi became the ruler, Libya was supplying 30% of
    Europe's energy supply

    -   The Suez was closed still, a Tapline in Syria had ruptured
        causing tankers carrying Saudi oil to triple their rate, this
        made Libya's oil of high value

-   Libya was set to nationalize their oil industry, but through tough
    dealings most of the companies who held concessions in Libya signed
    new deals. Libya would receive (with Occidental) a 20% increase in
    royalties and taxes. Their share in profit would shift from 50% to
    55%. This reopened the door to other oil producing countries to
    reignited their campaigns for sovereignty and control over their oil
    resources (which OPEC had used as propaganda a decade earlier). This
    was 1970.

-   By Nov. of 1970 Iran had struck new deals of 55%, and soon after
    every oil producing country was offered a similar prize. Venezuela
    introduced a new legislation which increase its share to 60%. By
    1971, Libya wanted to be a foot ahead of Iran and began to ask for
    more -- the new increasing demands would be endless if the companies
    did not find a way to create common front

-   The companies established a "Front Uni" similar to what had been
    done in the 20s against the U.S.S.R. "This modern Front Uni
    eventually comprised two dozen companies­ American and
    non-American-representing about four-fifths of free world oil
    production. The companies also created the Libyan Safety Net, a
    secret under­standing that if any company had its production cut back
    because it had stood up to the Qaddafi government, the other
    companies would provide replacement oil" (581).

-   In January 19, 1971, Front Uni had approached OPEC about a potential
    deal, but this would ultimately be theatre. Iran was in no position
    to create a deal for the entirety of OPEC. All of the gulf producing
    countries were also looking to establish a stronger foothold against
    the companies. The only members of OPEC who arrived to the meetings
    were the Gulf oil producing countries. During the meeting the
    countries had warned of an embargo to force the companies into make
    the deals that they wanted to. Furthermore, the Gulf oil producing
    countries would only strike deals on separate occasions.

-   There were two set of negotiations, one in Tehran and one in
    Tripoli. In Feb. 14, the companies went to Tehran. It was now a 55%
    take for Iran, an increase of ¢35 pbo with a further annual hikes.
    Exporters promised no increases for the next five years.

-   April 2, an agreement in Tripoli was announced. The price was raised
    by ¢95. Libya had increased their revenue by 50%

-   These deals became more of an illusion as OPEC sought to increase
    prices as the U.S moved the dollar out of the gold standard in the
    early 1970s.

-   OPEC was moving towards nationalizing their oil. Venezuela had
    legislation which would lead to nationalization once the concessions
    were over in the 1980s.

-   Iran had successfully nationalized their oil , see page 585.

-   Libya nationalized 51 of other companies, and 100% of some smaller
    companies.

-   Countries and companies realized that joint "participation" in
    development was better than nationalizing the oil industry.
    Countries didn't want to become de facto oil companies and the
    existing companies wanted to participate in the producing regions
    and get the oil to global markets.

-   By 1973, the world surplus production capacity was smaller than what
    it once was. 99% of the world oil was being used.

*Chapter 29-30 in the google doc*

## *Chapter 29 and 30, The Oil Weapon* and *"Bidding for Our Life"*    
- The U.S. was preparing to invade the Oil producing countries during this era in order to lower the price of oil. Why? Prior to this, the U.S had seen a dwindling supply of oil within its own territory. In the late-60s the U.S had only a third of the oil levels that it had during the mid-50s. Oil drilling and extraction was on a decline. Within the U.S’s political arena Nixon and Congress attempted to control and maintain some form of domestic industry (by ignoring George Shultz report/recommendation), but the attempt was meager as the industry was dying and the economy was moving towards a monetarist doctrine. By the end of the 60s oil and natural gas was running short in the U.S. A number of energy shortage/brownouts events occurred during the 69’-73’ era. “Energy crisis,” became a common term within the media as production could not meet the demand.
- During the early years of 73’, the white house was well informed on the Oil Shortage. James Akins had written a report, and even published an article, on how the U.S could approach the energy shortage, but none of his proposals were taken into consideration as they went against a conservative agenda of opening up the market. By 73’ import barriers had come down to meet the demand of the U.S market. By 73’ the U.S had doubled its importation of oil, from 3.2 million barrels to 6.2. It had become dependent on the Gulf region. During this moment much of the global North was opening their markets as well. The demand for oil was abundant, thus driving the prices of oil up. Just as much as importation grew, so did the price. Gulf oil producing countries sought to leverage their position within the frenzy of the growing market.
- As the market became tighter the public and political leaders within the Gulf sought to use the “oil weapon.” For the longest time Faisal, who presumably under U.S pressure, saw no benefit in cutting oil supplies. The idea to cut oil supplies was in discussion for quite some time prior to 73’. In the years 70’-73’ Anwar Sadat along with Hafez al-Assad, President of Syria, had begun preparations for a war in secret. Outside of Egypt and Syria only Faisal was aware. A part of the war preparations was a cut in oil supplies as well as renegotiations for Egypt’s economy. Sadat had sought to lift Egypt out of its economic state.
- During the years of 73’ Faisal began to loosen to the idea of cutting oil supplies, but not for the same reasons as Sadat or any other OAPEC member. Saudi’s share of oil exports around the globe had nearly doubled between the years 70’ to 73’, from 13 percent to 21. Libya and Kuwait shared similar increases, as well as an excess in earning revenues. The countries were earning more than what they could spend (and this will be addressed shortly). What became apparent within the production and exportation increases was a devaluation of the U.S dollar and potential damage within the oil fields as production met capacity. Kuwait and Libya had to restrain their production. The reason why Saudi agreed to production cuts can be seen for two reasons: one, the U.S essentially had Saudi in a chokehold as they mounted pressure with an invasion if Saudi did not agree to funnel their new revenue within New York Investment banks; secondly, in an attempt to quell public dissent Faisal needed to reassure the public that he was in an anti-U.S position by cutting supplies and pledging his allegiance to Palestine; pipelines within Saudi were being destroyed and the Soviet Union was seeking more influence within Egypt. These were two threats that needed to be addressed: the control of pipelines (which meant the control of the public, meaning politics, and the economy) and tempering U.S fever.
- King Faisal had warned top oil executives in the spring of 73’ that oil cuts would be imposed if the U.S did not disavow Israeli policies and actions. This came after severe pressure from Sadat who was ready for strong political action. The White House however did not believe that Saudi would resort to any extreme measure. In short, they ignored Faisal’s warning.
- By mid-summer Nixon had received another warning from Soviet General Secretary Leonid Brezhnev, that a war was impending in the Middle East and that the U.S needed to impose diplomatic initiative. But Nixon had saw the warning as a possible ploy for Soviet interest rather than an actual warning. By Aug. of 73’ Sadat had announced to Faisal that a war was imminent and that he needed his support. Faisal pledged half a billion dollars to Sadat’s war gambit. It was around this time, the summer and fall of 73’, where we see politics change economic doctrines by policy implementations and political action.
- This not only occurred in the Middle East, but in Europe and the U.S. For example, Germany had sought control of its energy supplies through the development of its first energy program (mostly due to the State Secretary Ulf Lantzke who felt the need to repress fears over capacity, as the 68’ OECD warning shook the public). That same fall Japan had released a statement that addressed the need to cope with an emergency in energy supplies (such as oil). Much of the globe was feeling a constraint and angst in their energy consumption, and some were experiencing the depleting supply. This is the era where much of the globe through different moments and developments shift from a Keynesian economy into a monetarist economy (from liberalism into neoliberalism).
- On Oct. 6, 1973 the October War began along the eastern bank of the Suez Canal and the northern side of Israel. In between Oct. 6-14 Israel was losing supply of its ammunitions, and they were in need of U.S weapons. OAPEC had warned that if the U.S would assist Israel that the cuts in oil would be more drastic than warned. In between those days the U.S was attempting to airlift supplies secretly into Israel. The U.S had pledged itself to Israel just as it did during the previous three wars. On Oct. 15, OAPEC had increased the price of oil up to 70%. By Oct. 17, they had agreed to continuously cut production by 5 percent every month until their needs are met; that is, Israel returning to its 67’ borders (UN-Resolution 242). On Oct. 20, Saudi, along with other OAPEC members, had cut back all oil supplies to the U.S and the Netherlands. Soon after to Portugal, South Africa, and Rhodesia. By Oct. 26, there was a cease-fire. In between the 20th and 25th the U.S had entered into a tense state with the U.S.S.R, so much so that both countries were under nuclear threat.
- By Nov., OAPEC had decided to increase the size of cuts across the board. Although cuts in supply had gone down by only 5 million barrels. In Oct. the supply levels were around 20 million, by Dec. they were 15 million. What made the shock more imposing was the fact that the U.S had little spare capacity. Iran had increased its production by 600,000 barrels per day. Iraq who had left the OAPEC group in late Sep. after being rejected for its proposal of a total economic embargo against every country had also increased its production. The total loss of barrels per day across the board was only 9% of the total availability of oil. In Dec., the price of oil had increased twofold from that of Oct., from $5.12 a barrel to $11.65.
- Around this time the embargo had begun to lessen in Saudi and Egypt. But it was not until Feb. of 74’ when the embargo was “completely” lifted. The true impact of the embargo took place during the months of Oct. through Dec. By Nov., Saudi and Egypt were already trying to back away from the embargo; Sadat had wanted to reduce the embargo as he had made progress in talks with the U.S; Saudi, under U.S pressure, was seeking a lateral agreement with the rest of the OAPEC countries. The embargo did not “officially” end until Feb. because Syria and Libya had dissented the proposals by the other OAPEC members.
## *Chapter 31, OPEC's lmperium*

-   OPEC members were denounced during the 70s as during that era world commerce was dictated by oil prices which they controlled
-   70s OPEC member were nearly all exporting countries except for U.S.S.R
-   OPEC was the new world bankers who would redistribute economic and political power. 74-78 was OPECs Golden Age
-   The tripling of oil prices in 73 brought massive earnings to exporters. In 1972 earnings were roughly \$23b by 1977 they were $140b
-   73' made the strategic access to oil the first order for industrial nations. 73' demonstrated volatility of the area.
-   In 74', there was a \$67b surplus, by 78' it was a \$2b deficit
-   OPEC tax sent industrial countries in a recession
-   Terms like 4^th^ world countries, and the global south erupted out of the OPEC alliance. The objective to redistribute wealth from the North to the South.
-   The real issue of OPEC was the question of the future -- how would prices be managed and maintained?
-   Saudi Arabia and Iran had shifted their rivalry from who could produce the most oil to who could control price and position
-   Saudi had warned the U.S of the Shah's volatility -- they were also against raising prices for themselves and the UAE (presumably because of the U.S's threat of an invasion)
-   The U.S and U.S.S.R discussed a possible oil deal at Disney land in 1975 -- the deal did not go through
-   In the 1970s Iran was half of Americas arm sales. Iran was seen as an ally in the middle east and a form of security for the U.S. Nixon, Ford, and Kissinger would not do anything that would sabotage their alliance
-   By 1977 Iran was strife with ailments and corruption. There was also fears that the U.S was ready to end their relationship with Iran. The Carter presidency had set a quest for price stability, "human rights," and the restriction on arms sales. The Shah was threatened by the admin. that if prices were not moderate like Saudi's than Iran would experience a prize freeze , further debilitating their economy. By 1978, oil prices had gone down to their pre-73 levels
-   In the mid-70s Kuwait, Venezuela, and Saudi were poised to nationalize their oil
-   In 1972, Venezuela had nearly nationalized their oil industry -- not technically, but they had passed numerous laws which allowed them to take control of the industry. In 83', the first concession was set to end.
-   By 1976 a deal was struck between Aramco and Saudi to nationalize their oil, the deal was not signed by Saudi until 1990.
-   All the nationalization deals were done in cooperation with the concessionary companies , but their relationship would dwindle over time. They would become contractors and production sharing contracts.
-   The total amount of oil being exported after nationalization and service to middleman had quintupled. In 1973 it was an increase of 8% to 1979 a 42% increase.

## *Chapter 32, The Adjustment*

-   Cheap oil helped to fuel economic growth in the 50s and 60s

-   The International Energy Agency became an energy emergency sharing program where govt. controlled strategic reserves of oil could be used in case of a disruption
    -   It provided a forum for national policies and research for new and old methods for energy
-   The 70s was an era of changing the objective conditions of the  market , specifically oil derived from its supply and demand balance  and the reliance of industrial economies on oil. Industrial economies took a path of shifting their dependence on oil. Europe, Japan, and the U.S looked towards alternative fuels, diverse oil sources, and conserving their reserves

-   Japan had begun to shift dramatically as the embargo had shown that
    their energy security was scarce and vulnerable. Japan began to
    implement technological shifts, such as nuclear programs, electric
    generation, and industrial production from oil to other fuel
    sources, such as coal and natural gas.

-   France pushed for a similar agenda.

-   Profits for oil grew in 72' by \$6.9b, to \$11.7b in 73', to \$16.4b
    in 74'

-   "The value and market prices of their American oil reserves also
    went up. Moreover, they had bought oil at lower prices, say \$2.90,
    before the increases, and had it in inventory, and then made money
    when they finally sold that same oil at \$11.65. Their chemical
    operations had also done well, helped by a weak dollar. But then
    profits dropped back to \$n.5 billion in 1975, lower than 1973.
    Again, the reasons were several. Overall oil demand was down because
    of a recession. The exporting countries noticed the profits that the
    companies were making on equity oil, and hurriedly proceeded to
    raise taxes and royalties to ensure that rents went into their
    treasuries and not to the companies. That was the year, as well,
    that some tax advantages were curtailed. Over the next few years,
    profits rose again, reaching \$15 billion in 1978, which in real
    terms meant that they were just about keeping up with inflation"
    (659).

-   Aug 74' Nixon steps down

-   Through the mid-70s the U.S was consumed by regulation -FEA and
    other various govt. agencies had spent several billions dollars on
    regulatory matters

-   Congress had finally passed the Alaskan Oil Pipeline TAPS in the 70s

-   Cars were regulated so as to improve their fuel efficiency by
    doubling it every 10 years

-   An American oil reserve was initiated

    -   Carter and Schlesinger tried to maneuver in various way through
        the political onslaught of energy policy

    -   The idea that high growth by high consumption which supported
        economic dev. in the 50s and 60s was no longer sustainable

-   Companies diversified into the non-oil business end of things

    -   Exxon went to office automation

    -   Arco bought copper

    -   Gulf began to buy into entertainment industries

-   OPEC throughout the 70s held a grip on about 65% of the worlds oil,
    by the end of the 70s new oil regions were beginning to have
    influence. Alaska, Mexico, and the North Sea. All of which were
    developed in the 60s and early 70s but due to political,
    environmental, and economic constraints they did not come into
    fruition until the late 70s

-   Mexico had a severed economy, oil was centralized in the domestic
    realm and their nationalized oil industry was not exporting oil. By
    the late 70s, Mexico began to import and borrow loans and money from
    various places around the globe -- with a new oil region, Mexico
    also became one of the largest oil forces in the world.

-   Oil price forecasting came out of the 73' shock, prior it had
    necessarily been in much use

-   "Iran was a fulcrum country, essential to stability in the region.
    It was a critical element in counterbalancing Soviet power and
    ambitions in the area, as well as those of radical and anti-Western
    forces. It was central to the security of the world\'s oil supplies,
    both as one of the world\'s two major exporters and as a regional
    power" (672).

## *Chapter 33, The Second Shock: The Great Panic*

-   In 77' Iran's govt. was strife with protest and demonstrations (in
    Qom) which had killed many participants

-   Iran's economy was unstable and corrupt. Khomeini was a leading
    voice in the opposition towards the Shah (as he remained in exile in
    Iraq). Khomeini was expelled from Iraq as Iraq needed to worry about
    their own Shiite population.

-   Attacks by the police only fueled more antagonism towards the Shah.
    Withdrawal of funds towards the Shia enraged the clergy. In Aug. of
    78' people were incinerated inside of a movie theater, one of half a
    dozen.

-   The Shah was diagnosed with cancer in 74', and by 78' he was dying.
    During that period strikes and demonstrations had immobilized the
    economy. The Iranian oil industry had become depressed, by Nov. of
    78' Iran was only exporting less than a million barrels a day --
    compared to the 4.5 million prior.

-   The U.S stance towards Iran was confused. During this period the
    Carter admin. was overwhelmed by the Camp David peace accords
    between Egypt and Isreal, arms negotiations with the U.S.S.R, and
    creating relations with China. Over time the Carter's admin. were
    wondering how to support the Shah in a time where there was so much
    distress in Iran. How could the U.S look like the good eyes?

-   In Dec. of 78' on the eve of Ashura thousands had gathered in
    opposition to the monarchy

-   On Christmas Iranian exports had ceased

-   Jan. 16, 79', the Shah had left Iran

-   Feb. 1, Kohmeini was making his return with Mehdi Bazargan as the
    new PM

-   A second oil shoch had consumed the world during the Iranian
    revolution. Saudi had increased its daily output to 10.5m, 2m above
    their ceiling. Iran was only 4-5% of the world total demand. Oil
    around the globe had increased by 150%.

    -   Why? Demand and consumption had increased since 76, and non-OPEC
        oil did not have the statistics to value what their impact was.
        The contractual arrangements were disrupted between oil
        companies and Iran. Companies had to find their lost oil
        elsewhere. Trading had become the norm in the oil industry.
        Buying oil from other countries and companies. Companies were
        bidding the price up , as govt. were trying to dampen them. Oil
        exporters due to the significant increase in value had increased
        the rents on oil. This stoked ideas around contingency.

-   "In short, the panic of 1979-80 saw self-fulfilling, and ultimately
    self-defeating, prophecy on a truly colossal scale. The oil
    com­panies were not alone in panic buying. Down the consumption
    chain, indus­trial users and utilities also furiously built
    inventories as insurance against rising prices and possible
    shortages" (687).

-   40% of BPs supplies came from Iran. It was also 20% of Japans total
    oil needs.

-   Exporting countries slashed their contracts and made oil available
    on spot basis while also increasing the price by 50%

-   Carter's admin. was under fire due to high inflation and a lack of
    oil resources

-   In the summer of 79' Iran imposed an embargo on Egypt for Anward
    Sadat's signing of the Camp David peace accords with Israel

-   Nigeria nationalized their oil

-   "But now state oil com­panies accounted for larger and larger shares
    of total production, they had no downstreams of their own, and they
    sold their oil to a wide spectrum of buyers: major oil companies,
    independent refiners, and traders." (697)

## *Chapter 34, "We're Going Down"*

-   In Nov. of 1979 Iran had taken three U.S embassy workers hostage.
    Shortly after Carter had frozen Iranian assets and placed an embargo
    on their oil

-   This only helped Iranians and the market to mark up the price of oil
    -- in order to protect their supplies

-   Companies continually leaped frogged prices. Saudi kept a steady
    upkeep of reserves.

-   On Sep. 22, 80', OPEC met in Vienna for a celebration but the event
    was canceled as within that same moment Iraq had launched an attack
    on Iran. This was the beginning of Iran-Iraq war.

-   The Iran-Iraq War had a major impact on global oil markets. Both
    Iran and Iraq were important oil producers, and the conflict
    disrupted their oil production and export capabilities. As a result,
    it led to a reduction in OPEC\'s overall oil output.

    -   During the Iran-Iraq war Iraq's oil nearly ceased and Iran's was
        cutoff. Nearly 4 million barrels were removed for the world
        market, about 15% of OPECs output and about 8% of the worlds
        demand. Oil had jumped during the war and spot prices came back
        again.

    -   Oil prices from OPEC would increase to \$36pb

-   The war also affected world oil demand to some extent, as it created
    uncertainty and volatility in the oil market, which can influence
    consumer behavior and economic activity. Countries were prepared
    this time as they had reserves.

-   IEA urged companies to not panic, but eventually as the war
    progressed they did

-   After a while non-OPEC companies surged , and OPEC was no longer the
    driving force in oil prices globally. OPEC had to bring the price of
    their oil down to the levels of Saudi. OPEC would not raise the
    price of oil for another 10 years

## *Chapter 35, Just Another Commodity?*

-   Towards the end of the 70s the U.S instituted a strict monetary
    policy , tied with high inflation, as high oil prices persisted

    -   The deepest recessions since the great one occurred in 80' and
        82'

    -   This caused a decline in oil demand in poorer countries

-   Fears of shortage in the 20s and 40s caused higher prices which in
    turn caused more tech. dev.. which then stimulated new quest for
    dev. areas

-   This pattern was repeated in the 70s, the \$34pb, when massive dev.
    was occurring outside of OPEC

-   The high price of oil fueled the changes in security, markets, and
    govt. policies, it also staged coal and nuclear power for electric
    generation. Oil was being pushed out of their markets.

    -   In 78' oils share of the energy market was 53%, by 85' it was
        43%

-   In 75' the U.S mandated the doubling fuel efficiency every 10 years.
    At the time the U.S was consuming about 2m barrels of oil per day ,
    which is what Alaska was producing at the time. By 85', the U.S 25%
    more energy efficient and 32% more oil efficient than in 73'. Japan
    at the same time was 31% more energy efficient and 51% more oil
    efficient.

-   In 83' the conservation of fuel and energy was clear. "Oil
    consumption in the noncommunist world was 45. 7 million barrels per
    day, about 6 million barrels less than the
    51.6-million­barrel-per-day level of 1979, which had been the high
    point. So, while demand had fallen 6 million barrels per day between
    1979 and 1983, non-OPEC pro­duction had increased by 4 million
    barrels per day. On top of that, the oil companies eagerly sought to
    dispose of the tremendous inventories they had built up in
    anticipation of a demand level that never materialized." (718)

-   The Iranian revolution and the Iran-Iraq war had made both of those
    exporting countries oil markets dwindle, but instead of a shortage
    at the time there was a large surplus of production capacity over
    market demand

-   OPEC was losing ground of their share of the market as spot prices
    were a loss in profit and as other competitors were encroaching on
    their market territories. In March of 82', OPEC had cut production
    levels in order to stabilize and preserve their price levels --
    except for Saudi which would always adjust its output in order to
    support the system

-   In June of 82', Israel had intervened directly into Lebanon.

-   King Khalid had died from his chronic heart disease

    -   Prince Fahd had succeeded

-   During this period deman was not recovering for OPEC, non-OPEC
    production was rising, and spot pricing was dwindling. OPEC was
    still overpriced and overabundant.

-   By 83' Saudi's production had fallen to their 70' level. They were
    losing their share in the market as other competitors were buying
    cheaper oil. OPEC was in a crisis.

-   Oil in the north sea had cut their prices by \$3, then \$30pb. This
    had collapsed Nigerias economy as they were entirely dependent on
    oil and competing with the North Sea enterprise

-   OPEC responded by cutting their prices to \$29pb, March of 83'

-   Saudi was responsible for 1/3 of the worlds reserves , which meant
    that they were responsible for maintaining balance quantities to
    meet market requirements

-   Oil had shifted from securing access to supplies to securing access
    over markets. Up til the 70s no more than 10% of oil was in the spot
    market, by 82' more than half of oil was in the spot market or sold
    at prices keyed to the spot market. Countries were responsible for
    their market, resources, and oil. Companies were becoming buyers and
    traders.

-   BP was pushing the spot-market system. After countries had
    nationalized like Iran and Nigeria, BP had lost 40% of its supply.
    BP had become decentralized pushing for individual units to become
    entrepreneurs

-   70s the corporate world had changed from supply planning to trades
    and commercialization

-   Nymex introduced future contracts -- buyer can buy a commodity at a
    future price, a producer could sell a commodity at a future price.
    After deregulation in the 70s, futures came after everything

-   The NY Mercantile Exchange began by trading eggs to potatoes, all
    under future contracts, starting in 1872. The exchange was coming
    under threat as in 76' and 79' potatoes were about to drop out from
    the exchange. Nymex then introduced heating oil in, and in 81 it
    started trading futures in gasoline, and in 83' they introduced the
    futures for crude oil -- two weeks after OPEC had cut their prices.
    Now crude could bought and sold for more profits between traders and
    speculators. Within a few years companies and countries were trading
    futures. It minimized the risk from the spot market. Arab light was
    once used to set the benchmark price, but by now it was West Texas
    Intermediate.

-   By 81' oil was deregulated in the U.S

-   As anticipated, deregulation dismantled protective barriers,
    intensifying market competition and giving rise to corporate
    transformations like consolidations, spin-offs, takeovers, and
    various strategic shifts. The combination of overcapacity and
    falling prices further accelerated consolidation, streamlining
    operations for enhanced efficiency and augmented profitability.
    Companies also began scrutinizing the \"value gap,\" denoting the
    disparity between a company\'s stock value and the assessed worth of
    its oil and gas reserves relative to other firms. This metric served
    as a gauge for whether a company was undervalued or overvalued.
    Given the significant trading of oil in futures markets, numerous
    enterprises embarked on stock enhancement endeavors by acquiring
    undervalued oil companies.

-   It was cheaper to buy smaller companies than it was to explore for
    oil

-   As the industry was coming down, it revealed how interconnected oil
    was to the global finance system -- so much so that in the late 70s
    and early 80s Mexico's recession could have nearly jeopardized the
    entire global banking system

-   The U.S had bailed out Continental Illinois as their loans to oil
    were completely empty

-   This was the era of mergers. By 85' Europe, the U.S, and Russia had
    created a meeting the G7 where the topic was deregulation , free
    market politics, and privatization.

-   Through all the mergers and acquisitions, layoffs, and
    restructuring, over \$100b was put into the pockets of institutions
    and individual shareholders, pensions, etc.

## *Chapter 36, The Good Sweating: How Low Can It Go? *

-   OPECs 1984 new quota system was not working, non-OPEC forms of
    energy were expanding

-   Since the 70s, BNOC had controlled the prices for which oil was
    bought and sold for. BNOC would purchase oil from the North Sea and
    sell it to refiners. In 1985, Thatcher had dissolved BNOC which had
    removed an anchor from OPEC, it allowed for the volatile market to
    have more control over prices. OPEC had faced the choice of either
    raising prices or lowering them. As Saudi was the swing state, as it
    had to defend prices, it meant that Saudi was dropping their output
    , market share, and revenue. In 81' Saudi had a revenue of \$119b by
    84' it was \$36b to 85' \$26b

-   In June 85', Saudi had warned other countries that they would need
    to stabilize the market. Within a few weeks nothing had changed and
    Saudi had diminished its oil output

-   Saudi struck a deal with refiner during this moment by giving them a
    fixed incentive: \$2pb, no matter what the barrel is selling for in
    the market; Saudi's net price had disappeared, which meant that OPEC
    did not have a net price

-   Slowly the price of oil began to fall, this would disrupt other
    non-OPEC producers as it could potentially go well below their
    "price-floor"

-   The oil pricing system was extremely low, barrels for being sold for
    mere dollars. This like high prices could send European and U.S
    economies into disarray

-   In the last weeks of 86' OPEC met to discuss a new quota system, one
    where Saudi maintained a dominant share in the market.

## *Epilogue*

-   89' end of the soviet union

-   From 1985 to 1990 barrels of oil had increased from 615b to 917b

-   The Gulf's oil share of the world was 70% at the time

-   Iraq invades Kuwait in 90'

-   Much of the dispute was over an oil field in which Saddam had felt
    was Iraqs

-   In 89' Russia was producing more than double the amount of oil than
    Saudi

-   After the 73' oil shock companies realized that govt. had to take on
    the role of managing crisis and future crisis

-   "Yet the course of the five major disruptions from the early 1950s
    through the early 1980s has revealed that the logistical and supply
    system can adapt to such an extent that the shortages ended up being
    less dire than had been expected. Indeed, the real problem turned
    out not to be an absolute shortage, but the disruption of the supply
    system and the confusion over ownership of oil, with the consequent
    rush to reorder the system under conditions of high uncertainty"
    (775)

-   Much of the epilogue is hypotheticals and ideas on how oil will move
    in the future
