## A Musical Catastrophe

-   Not much information about music in Palestine before 1900 and
    between 1900 and 1936

    -   There's information about folklore and heritage

-   Broadcasting industry in Palestine began after 1936

-   Music around 1900 was very similar to music in Greater Syria, music
    was happening everywhere

    -   *Mayjanā, 'atābā, and zajal* are all forms of various folk songs
        that could be found anywhere in the region

-   There were also organs, pianos, as the Armenians and other ethnic
    groups brought in other cultures

    -   Armenians first presence in Jerusalem was in the 3^rd^ century

-   Festivities then vs. now served different purposes, back then it was
    more social vs. today it being more tied events? Although events
    occurred then as well

-   Once the British came and began infrastructure with Palestine, the
    economy changed from a farm intensive economy to a
    manufacturing/farm economy. New forms of labor were brought in
    Jerusalem. Arab classical music shifted its ties to an aristocratic
    class.

-   The music during the early 20^th^ century was not detached from what
    was happening in surrounding regions/nations

-   "So for them, the person who went from Jerusalem to Beirut was just
    like someone going from Ramallah to Jerusalem today. They were all
    present in the same area and dealt with it as such. Going to Beirut
    was just going to another city, where the accent is just a little
    different." (40)

-   Palestine in the early 20^th^ century was more of a platform and
    showcase for other artist and musicians

-   Jerusalem Radio was established in 1936, it is believed that it was
    a govt. establishment meant to publicize policies by the British

    -   Three sections of the radio station, English, Arabic, Hebrew,
        all protesting and commanding different things

-   The radio station was opened in Ramallah during a moment of protest
    and strikes

    -   It was watched by the Dept. of Post, Telegraph, and Telephone,
        except the news

    -   The news was under the Dept. of Publications

-   1940 mandate established the Near East Radio through the British
    Foreign Ministry, first in Jenin then in Jaffa

-   Radio Jerusalem closed in 1948 with the occupation of Palestine

-   We should find Abd al-Wahab composed *kulli dah kān lay* \[All of
    this for what!\]

-   The Near East Radio required the staff to be musically trained,
    after 1948, the policies in the Near East Radio is what helped other
    radio stations across the Arab world, as the new employees were
    trained

-   A lot of the recordings from Jerusalem radio are either lost,
    destroyed, or at the Hebrew University

-   After Nakba, Jerusalem Radio was under the authority of Jordan, and
    the music changed from patriotic music to music of the Hashemite
    Kingdom of Jordan, gradually the Palestinian ceased to talk about
    himself

-   It was other nationalist that began to talk about Palestine (?)

-   When Jordan imposed authority over the west bank, music became apart
    of the new programs in which King Hussein supported

-   "the Palestinians went through a process of "Jordanization" in the
    period between 1949 and 1967, and that continued to have an impact
    for years afterwards. Musical pockets of different kinds started to
    appear after 1967." (48)

-   Look up *Studio Number One*

-   Atallah Shoufani

## Negotiating the Elements

-   It is hard to study Palestinian music after Nakba

-   \[to find\] Mustafa al- Kurd, a songwriter from Jerusalem; al-
    Baraem and Sabreen, two Jerusalemite musical groups; and Firqat
    Aghāni al- \"Ashiqeen, or simply Al- \"Ashiqeen, a Palestinian
    protest ensemble operating from Syria.

-   During the beginning of the 20^th^ century there was a debate
    amongst Arab musicians about whether art should be for arts sake or
    for the people

    -   This debate connected urban centers like Istanbul, Beirut,
        Aleppo, and Damascus to Palestinians

-   The displacement of Palestinians after Nakba made repertoire
    associated with Arab music less important to the displaced

-   Post-48 Palestine became a topic for pan-arabism and decolonialism

-   1950s and 60s, Bethlehem and Ramallah were booming with latin vogue
    within the youth. Jazz and Rock was also introduced.

-   Introductions to European and U.S based instruments was encouraged
    by the rising middle class in the 50s and 60s

-   After the 67' war most professional musicians settled in Jordan and
    did not return

-   After 67', it was left to enthusiast and amateurs to figure out what
    to do

-   The six day war weakend pan-arabism and Nasser's influence, it also
    opened the door for the Jordan-based PLO

-   Post 67', music, books, and art were controlled by Israel

-   Israel and Jordan were the only suppliers to the West Bank

-   The early 70s was a moment of political-cultural revival in the West
    Bank, where music interest grew among the youth

-   "Some were influenced by the 1967 war and the expansion of the
    Israeli occupation, while others were influenced by the 1960s and
    1970s era of activism and free expression." (55)

-   The set the stage for an aesthetic dedicated to the creation and
    performance of meaningful and cause-commited art

-   Find Mustafa al-Kurd and *Balaleen*

-   Al-Kurd's songs were seen as political in nature, and his music was
    heard all across the occupied territories

-   *Sec. Cit. Por. & Per*, in 1966 played only Western pop and rock
    music, they changed their name to the Tiger Five. After Black Sept.
    in 1970 they changed their name *al-Barā'im*

-   "there was a per-vasive sentiment of disappointment in the great
    Arab singers, including Um Kul-thoum. He remembers that the
    repertoire associated with these icons was viewed as contributing to
    the defeat of the Arab armies against Israel in 1967, based on its
    propagandist exaggerations of Arab power (Ashrawi, interview)." (57)

-   Find *Bi Ummī \"Aynī* (With my own eyes) -- this was broadcasted in
    Syria TV

    -   There music reflected the Palestinian struggle and movement

-   Find *Aghānī al-'Āshiqīn (Al-'Ashiqeen)*

    -   A musical group made of Palestinians living in Syria

-   By the end of the 70s, it became difficult to navigate the
    politicized scene of the west bank as the authoritarian principles
    of PLO deepened

-   In the early 80s the parameters had shifted for cultural ventures in
    the west bank: "So instead of engaging in an organized political
    movement, which was often seen as a restrictive approach to making
    art, many groups used the politically charged situation as an
    opportunity for experimentation and learning." (61)

-   Musical group Sabreen

    -   Mixed traditional folk music styles and were active in their
        choice of words
