# Oil Crisis

-   In the 1960s there was some realization that some cooperative
    arrangement was needed between producers in order to control the
    prices of their oil

    -   Not new in the 1960s but established through the Gulf by OPEC on
        Sept. 14^th^

-   Individual policies were changed in order to improve bargaining
    power, older agreements were revised in order to suit the change
    within the oil market/new oil companies (producer countries
    nationalizing)

-   The sales-purchase agreement, with the consortium, asserts that Iran
    has complete sovereignty over their oil reserves; other oil
    producing countries established a base for participating in Iran's
    oil business. Iran formally nationalized their oil in 61'. Although
    it rejected the partnership system as unsuitable, the extended terms
    offered by the International Oil Consortium did not fulfill Iran's
    interest

-   In 1975, Kuwait was still a 60-40 split between BP. Bahrain would
    eventually become 60% shareholder in BAPCO. Abu Dhabi would follow
    suit. Qatar and Saudi would take complete control.

-   OPEC assumed the right to determine the prices of their oil

-   Between 1970 to 1974, SWA countries oil income increased about 7
    fold. From \$9b to \$60b.

-   By 1974 oil was roughly 68% of the world energy supply

-   Wizarat believed that oil companies believed that oil would run out
    within the next 30 years

-   Europe and the U.S believed that producing countries raised the
    prices too quickly, brought an impending doom to democracy and
    democratic institutions, and strengthened nationalism. The future of
    the free world was at stake if oil prices were not brought down.

-   The economic crisis is believed to have accrued because of the U.S
    involvement in the Vietnam war. The U.S had a large amount of
    balance of payment deficits in order to pay for the war

-   Many European countries and the U.S began to experience inflation
    during 60s, and even more during the 70s

-   U.S wheat prices jumped 192%, cement 27%, heavy trucks increased by
    25%, and machinery increased immediately before the increase of oil
    prices -- producing countries insisted that oil price increases were
    necessary as the "West" was experiencing soaring inflation

-   It was believed that OPEC's surplus would increase to over 1,000\$ b
    dollars, but that was a projection made by "current dollars" (the
    rate of inflation that would increase the dollar figure) versus
    "constant dollars" (the buildup in terms of the *current* dollar).
    The constant dollar projection was \$300 b. The original projection
    was high because it did not take into account the consuming
    countries would reduce their importation, and the developmental
    trends in oil-exporting countries.

-   In 1975, over \$100b was allocated for developmental projects within
    oil-exporting countries, contracts signed with foreign firms

-   Saudi intended on utilizing the surplus for substituting oil income
    by industrializing, and building a new steel industry and
    petrochemical industry

    -   Funds would be used for U.S agricultural industry, fertilizer
        factories, and large irrigation schemes

-   "The Arab World Bank is assisting Egypt in reopening of the Suez
    Canal; building power plants in Jordan; helping Sudan in the ex-
    pansion of irrigation works; and repairing war damage in Syria"
    (23).

-   "Petrodollars are playing a role in Iran's drive for higher levels
    of development and social welfare"

-   Iranian Industries and Mines Minister had insisted on
    industrializing so as to lessen the dependence on oil, in June of 74

-   The transportation of petrodollars from oil-exporting countries to
    industrialized countries was also done through construction projects

-   Since the start of the fiscal year in 1974 (July 1^st^), the U.S
    export \$3.1B worth of arms to Iran, Oman, Saudi, and Kuwait,
    roughly \$415m a month.

-   Other forms of investments out of the oil-exporting countries goes
    into real estate/companies in the U.S and Europe. Iran and Kuwait
    have substantial holdings in Krupp and Daimler-Benz

    -   Krupp was responsible for almost 100,000 slave labourers during
        the holocaust, they held a concentration camp outside of
        Auschwitz

    -   In the 1890s, 50% of Krupps production was arms manufacturing

    -   Saudi as of now is invested in Krupps

-   Saudi had previously shown interest in investing in Britain to open
    up the future prospects for trade between the two , but to also
    offset the size of the British oil deficits

-   "The more the oil-exporting countries earn from the sale of their
    oil, the more they will be able to import from the industrialized
    countries, thus retransferring substantial amounts of petrodollars
    to these industrialized countries" (24).

-   The UAE set up a bank to help agricultural projects in developing
    countries. Called Abu Dhabi Fund for Arab Economic Development
    (ADFAED)

-   The Arab-African fund was originally 165 m pounds

-   Kuwait increased the Fund for Arab Economic Dev. from \$6,00 million
    to \$3b, to extend beyond just Arab countries

-   UN General assembly in 1974, special session on Raw materials and
    Development recognized the sovereignty of all states over their
    natural resources

-   Japan imports (74') 90% of petrol from the Arab oil-producing states

-   Europe and Japan view oil-exporting differently than the U.S.

-   The energy crisis seemed to have been a pretext for the U.S control
    and domination over economic and political relationships with Japan
    and Western Europe

-   Oil used as a weapon
